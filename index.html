        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">D</span>aily, each family's history is made
          by its individual members. Yet, we don't usually recognize the
          importance of many of these family events until it's too late to
          recapture them. However, the recording of family history is one of the
          most important types of historical preservation. For, it is our
          ancestors who blaze the trails before us, who inspire us, and from
          whom we learn much of what eventually makes us who and what we are.
          Thus, how can we begin to know and understand ourselves unless we
          attempt to know and understand those who went before us?
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason we wanted to put together this booklet is to share the bits
          and pieces of knowledge we all have, and to attempt to gather more
          information which will help us to understand the first and second
          generations of Limjaps and the times in which they lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we had started our project twenty years ago, the knowledge of the
          third generation of Limjaps about their parents and grandparents would
          have filled volumes and volumes. Much vital information which only
          they could have given us is now probably gone forever. We have lost
          the details of our ancestors' character traits, their habits, their
          daily routines, and the numerous "<span class="em">kwento</span>"
          which all families have that brings its family members to life.
          Instead, we are left with a skeleton of facts and we must dig hard and
          deep for more facts that will add flesh to our subjects. When we find
          new facts, we sometimes have to try to figure out what they mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other problems. The ravages of time, three wars and other
          calamities have destroyed much important information. Many family
          letters, photos, and scrapbooks have been lost. Our own memories about
          stories we've heard have dimmed as well. There are also gaps in public
          and private historical collections. One example of this is that, after
          finally locating a microfilmed newspaper article from the 1890s about
          Mariano Limjap, we quickly discovered that the microfilm had
          deteriorated completely and nothing could be read on that roll.
          Another frustration concerns our search for the early Binondo parish
          records, which we hoped might give us information on Ling Cong Jap's
          baptism, his marriage to Policarpia Nolasco and the subsequent baptism
          of their children, among other information. Each clue leads to a
          source that points us in another direction to another source. But, as
          each doors closes, others open, and we still haven't lost hope of
          finding these records.
        </p>
        <p>
          That, however, will take more time than we have for this book.
          Although we started our research in April and worked almost daily
          through October, we can already see that several more years will be
          needed to ensure as much as is humanly possible at all avenues have
          been thoroughly researched. We need to look deeper into the Spanish
          era documents, many of which are in the National Archives, where many
          documents have never being sure exactly what we'll find.
        </p>
        <p>
          By our next reunion in the year 2000, we anticipate being able to add
          more information on Jaoquin and Policarpia Nolasco Limjap, on Mariano
          and Maria Escolar Cochay Limjap, and on Jacinto and Clotilde Alonzo
          Limjap, perhaps in Volume II of The House of Limjap. However, the
          focus of that volume will be on the third generation of Limjaps, with
          each family member's life story being told. For that, we propose now
          that we agree that we, the fourth generation, will do the research on
          our parents with supplemental information to be provided by our
          children and others who also knew them. We must not lose our chance to
          do this now before it's too late-for the sake of all the Limjaps who
          will follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we should, over and above what I already have gathered, start
          thinking of collecting all our information and storing it on CD-ROMs.
          Even books, photos, clippings and scrapbook information can be out on
          them, which would provide a more economical way of storing the
          information and one which would permit access by all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've tremendously enjoyed the time spent on putting this volume
          together and the time I've spent talking to and comparing notes with
          my cousins and close friends of the family. I feel I now have a
          clearer understanding of our Limjap ancestors, and an even greater
          appreciation for the lives they lived, the achievements they attained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very special thanks must go to the following people, without whose
          assistance and participation, this volume would not have been
          possible. I thank my daughter Riz Boncan Marsella for suggesting that
          I write this book, for providing assistance on the layout and the
          cover design. I thank my sons, Marcelo who computer scanned the
          Aguinaldo letters, and Raul, Jr. who computer scanned all the pictures
          and took charge of the layout, cover design, and printing. To my
          cousins, nephews and nieces listed below who provided information,
          translations from Spanish to English, pictures, letters, paintings,
          other documents, and recollections, I offer my heartfelt thanks: Jose
          Limjap, Mariano Limjap, Nahum Limjap, Popoy Limjap, Lydia Limjap
          Mandac, Naz Limjap Mandac, Mary Limjap Santos, Monching Limjap Osmena,
          Ate Lulu Limjap, Marita Escolar Alfonso, Charito Escolar Alfonso,
          Ambassador Manuel Yan, Marita Limjap Ubaldo Marasigan, Pacita Limjap
          Ubaldo Filart, Johnny Rodriguez, Florencio Azarraga, Rose Santos, Inez
          Santos Ancheta, Marilou Ubaldo Bautista, Lia Osmena Valencia, Ching
          Limjap and Ofie Limjap Vitek.
        </p>
        <p>
          To family friends Ben Javier and Dr. Rosalino Reyes, I extend my
          appreciation for providing their recollections, particularly those
          about Lola Angoy. I am grateful to Felix Maramba, Jr., Fiona Paua, and
          my sister Chit Boncan Herbosa for providing important reference books.
          My special thanks go to Evelyn Limjap Ignacio, Connie Limjap Lichauco,
          Kelly Boncan, and Riz Boncan Marsella for taking the time to read the
          first draft of the manuscript and for making invaluable suggestions
          and for the title suggestions. I thank Betty Yangco Daly,
          granddaughter of Luis R. Yangco and a close family friend, for
          confirmation of information on her grandfather. I would like to thank
          Mrs. Uy Pit Yong and Charlie Uy for translating information from
          Chinese to English and for helping in the search for records in China
          which is still underway. I am grateful to Jose Lim Chu Tick, who
          assisted us in reaching the Se Jo Tong (The Lim Family Association),
          and to the personnel there who provided assistance to us. I also would
          like to extend my appreciation to Mrs. Peter Lim and her husband
          Peter, my good friend who, sadly, died during the time of this book's
          preparation. Their translation of English to Chinese on certain
          documents, and their other advice was invaluable. To all of these
          people and to others from whom they may have received information and
          assistance, thank for taking the time to help complete this project.
          If I have inadvertently omitted to mention others who have helped in
          this work or failed to include information, I apologize for any such
          oversights. In case there are errors or omissions in the book, kindly
          let me know so we can list the corrections, hopefully in Volume II.
        </p>
        <p>
          My special acknowledgement to Gracia San Miguel for researching
          tirelessly to gather invaluable information from virtually all the
          libraries and archives in Manila.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, at the suggestions of my daughter Kelly, I have placed a list
          after this introduction of Limjap family members of the first, second
          and third generations. This should help guide the younger Limjaps to
          better identify the relationships of the personalities involved. So,
          now, I say let us plan to build further our story of the House of
          Limjap, and until our next reunion.

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">L</span>
          <span class="bold">im Cong Jap's</span>
          early life in <span class="em">Amoy</span> (now
          <span class="em">Xiamen</span>), China and his travels with the
          British merchant are a family legend, with the details we so long for
          lost to the mists of time. The apprenticeship, a long establish
          tradition in England and continental Europe, became a very young Lim
          Cong Jap's ticket to adventure, education, economic freedom, to a new
          life in a new country, to a new name and a new life identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The well-known Chinese saying that
          <span class="bold"
            >a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step</span
          >
          could not have been more true for Lim Cong Jap, and countless Chinese
          immigrants before and after him. Making that decision, taking that one
          step and then another and another and another led him into a different
          life that perhaps he never could have imagined. Not only would he
          prosper and bring honor to his family, but his son would be part of a
          new nation in the making and among the first people of a new
          nationality, the Filipino.
        </p>

        <p>
          What forces propelled him from his homeland? Why would he want to
          settle in a land that under Spanish rule had discriminated against the
          Chinese, had expelled them en masse a number of times, and had
          massacred in vast numbers century after century?
        </p>

        <p>
          Lim Cong Jap was born in
          <span class="em">Amoy</span>
          in 1832 during the latter years of the
          <span class="em">Ch'ing (or Qing) Dynasty (1644-1911)</span>. In the
          19th century, China became increasingly isolated and underdeveloped.
          Consequently, the Chinese people suffered and many sought a better
          life elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          To the Chinese, particularly to those from
          <span class="em">Fukien Province</span>, the
          <span class="em">Philippines</span>, which they called "<span
            class="em"
            >Nanyang</span
          >", had long been known as a nearby paradise of warm islands where
          food was plentiful and opportunity abounded. This contrasted sharply
          with life in China at that time.

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">J</span>udging by early reported accounts,
          entering Manila Bay and its harbor area for the first time must have
          been a pleasant experience for Lim Cong Jap, one which, perhaps, could
          be seen as an omen for his future life there. Its early visitors found
          it breathtakingly beautiful. Manila was an attractive port city,
          surrounded by unpolluted rivers and thickly forested mountains, which
          could be clearly seen from the Bay since there was no air pollution.
          The Frenchman <span class="em">Lafond de Lurcy</span> wrote "<span
            class="bold"
            >There are few bays in the world that are as beautiful as
            Manila's</span
          >". To this land of <span class="em">beauty</span>,
          <span class="em">bounty</span> and
          <span class="em">opportunity</span> came Lim Cong Jap.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Spanish first arrived in Manila, there was a small group of
          about 150 Chinese men, women and children, one of the last settlements
          of complete Chinese family units permitted by the Spanish. Afterwards,
          Spanish colonial empire, its administrators divided the population
          into ethnic divisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Philippines, Spaniards born in Spain were called
          <span class="em">Peninsulares</span>, Spaniards born in the
          Philippines were called <span class="em">Insulares</span> or
          <span class="em">Filipinos</span>, natives were called
          <span class="em">Indios</span>. Chinese were
          <span class="em">Chinos</span>. The Chinese were divided further into
          non-Christianized and Christianized Chinese. The decision that only
          Chinese men could reside in the Philippines led to the creation of
          another official category, the
          <span class="em">mestizo de Chino</span> or the
          <span class="em">Chinese mestizo</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's interesting to note that some authorities believe that, because
          of centuries of Chinese assimilation before the Spanish arrived, a
          large percentage of the native population were, in fact, already part
          Chinese. Of course, another theory is that most Southeast Asian
          peoples actually originated in southern China anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chinese steadily increased. We don't have population figures for
          1850, but in 1749, there were about 40,000 Chinese in the Philippines
          and by 1886 almost 67,000, most in Manila.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if Lim Cong Jap had not known a single person in the Philippines
          before he arrived, upon arrival, the Chinese community would have
          assisted him in finding a job, negotiating the Spanish bureaucracy,
          and beginning a new life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, we don't know how long he worked for the British
          trader. However, obtaining work in Manila, apparently, was not a
          problem, especially for the industrious Chinese and Chinese mestizo.
          They virtually controlled the retail trade, the arts and crafts
          trades, and a countrywide network of Chinese purchasing agents, who
          bought agricultural commodities at source, and sold them to the
          foreign trading firms. They had begun to enter the field of
          inter-island trade as well, having already established their hold on
          inter-island shipping.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, there were also many community organizations among the
          Manila Chinese. Initially, informal gatherings occurred among those
          from the same provincial areas. Later, there were family clan
          gatherings. Subsequently, some of those formed into organized
          associations and one of the oldest is the Se Jo Tong, also known as
          the Lim Family Association, founded in 1908. Other organizations
          included trade guilds, known as gremios, various other community-wide
          associations, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most prominent community association over the years has been the
          Chinese Charitable Association. It was founded in 1877, and then as
          now it had oversight responsibilities for the Chinese General Hospital
          and the Chinese Cemetery (originally located in Binondo).
        </p>

        <p>
          Lim Cong Jap was a Director of this charitable organization. "<span
            class="em"
            >Limjap Street</span
          >" in the Chinese Cemetery named in memory of him and his charitable
          work for others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, from the cradle to the grave, the Manila Chinese worked together
          almost as one unit to protect and support their own. This unity was
          one of their greatest strengths and a major reason for their
          commercial success as well. Their success did not come to them by
          connections only and without effort, however, but by their hard work,
          thrifty habits, and by being prepared for opportunities when they
          arose.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, Lim Cong Jap would have quickly become part of a vast network of
          family and business ties that would be of importance to him and to his
          future family as well. Throughout the Philippines, ties formed a
          century and a half ago have in many, many cases continued to this day.
          For example, as we'll see in later chapters, Telesforo Chuidian, Luis
          Yangco and Mariano were together in various situations. Today, their
          grandchildren are still good friends.

      <article class="content">
        <h1>Chapter 3: The First Limjap: His Milestones</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">W</span>e may tend to think that Spain's
          desire for economic gain in the Philippines was its main reason for
          being there. Actually, from the beginning, the Spanish also saw their
          occupation of the Philippines as being a religious mission of the
          utmost importance. In addition, Spain wanted to get its toe into China
          and establish religious missions there. It hoped to convert Chinese
          nationals in Manila to Christianity and to maintain such good terms
          with them that China would permit Spain's entry into that country as
          well and it hoped some of the Christianized Chinese would become
          missionaries to China.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Dominican Church of San Gabriel was built within the Parian
          (abolished in the 18th century) to minister to the Chinese and convert
          them. Later on, the Dominicans established Binondo Church and the
          Jesuits the Santa Cruz Church to serve the Christianized Chinese
          communities there. Conversion, baptism, and marriage were the first
          steps to assimilation. For example, marriage between a Chinese
          immigrant and a Catholic mestiza or india could not occur until the
          immigrant was baptized.
        </p>

        <p>
          Baptisms were not necessarily individual affairs, at least in the
          early years. When Lam-Co, who was from Fukien Province and who
          eventually became the great-great grandfather of Jose Rizal, was
          baptized in 1697, there were other converts also baptized in the same
          ceremony.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the immigrant was baptized, he took a new name as well as a new
          religion. In Lam-Co's case, he took the name Domingo since he was
          baptized on a Sunday. Other converts frequently took their godparent's
          name either as their first and middle names or as their last name. We
          believe that Lim Cong Jap's godfather may have been a Barrera. He may
          have even been named Joaquin Barrera, which are the names Lim Cong Jap
          took as his first and second names.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some immigrants combined their Chinese names into one to create a new
          family name. This is partially what Lim Cong Jap did by eliminating
          the Cong and joining Lim and Jap into one. In some published work,
          Limjap is written as Limhap. However, under Spanish pronunciation that
          is used in the Philippines, "<span class="em">h</span>" would have
          been silent and the name would have been spoken as "<span class="em"
            >Limap</span
          >", thus the Limhap spelling is incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incidentally, Lim is the Fukienese family name and is written first as
          is the Chinese custom. The Chinese characters translate into English
          as follows:

          <img class="sm-icons" src="./i/lim-icon.png" />
          Lim means "<span class="bold">woods</span>",

          <img class="sm-icons" src="./i/cong-icon.png" />
          Cong means "<span class="bold">light</span>",

          <img class="sm-icons" src="./i/jap-icon.png" />
          and Jap means "<span class="bold">togetherness</span>". The same
          family name Lim is written Lin in Mandarin and Lam in Cantonese.
        </p>
        <p>
          After his baptism, Lim Cong Jap was Joaquin Barrera Limjap, and he
          would now be permitted to marry a Christian mestiza, which he did when
          he married Policarpia Nolasco from Binondo. Unfortunately, we don't
          have any details of their wedding ceremony, but we surmise that it was
          held sometime in 1855. According to the unwritten rules of the day, we
          can also assume that they were of the same economic and social
          standing.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Austin Craig, the Chinese men were considered good
          catches - hard-working, good providers, who were thoughtful of their
          wives, and who were known to be good fathers. Craig notes that the
          socially prominent Bisayans, who were Manila leaders before the
          Spanish arrived, were eager for their daughters to marry Chinese
          husbands.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Dominicans had high hopes for the newly baptized Chinese.
          Naturally, they were expected to marry and, since Spanish policy did
          not permit Chinese women to live in the Philippines, intermarriage
          between cultures, with religion as the unifying factor, became a
          desirable aim of the Order, and was therefore acceptable in the
          culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Go betweens were often used, especially in the early years. It is
          believed that this custom of go betweens, once Filipino custom,
          originated with the Chinese. After the families had agreed upon the
          match, the parish priest sought to ensure there were no impediments to
          the marriage. Once the priest was satisfied, banns were read in the
          parish church for three consecutive Sundays. Only after all of these
          proceedings were completed could the wedding ceremony be held.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mestizo children naturally followed marriages. In the Limjap family,
          Mariano was the eldest and was born on October 19, 1856. Jacinto was
          born on August 30, 1865, nine years later. Apolonio, the youngest son,
          was born February 9, 1869. Since Mariano mentions Jacinto and Apolonio
          in his will but no other brothers or sisters, we assume there were
          none.

        <p>
          Early on, the Christianized Chinese were given extra privileges. For
          example, whenever the Spanish decided there were too many Chinese (who
          during most of Spanish colonial rule outnumbered the Spanish), they
          would deport large numbers of non-Christians back to China. Those who
          were Christians were permitted to stay. Naturally, those who got to
          stay were able to take over the jobs of those who were deported. They
          were given other incentives as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, in 1594, Binondo was founded as an area for the land
          tax-free. Later on, when natives and others moved to Binondo, they had
          to pay rent to the Christianized Chinese. Santa Cruz was founded later
          along similar lines, but with Jesuit priests.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were centuries of persecution, all well documented. Overall,
          however, from the late 18th century up to the late 19th century, the
          Spanish official policies toward the Philippine Chinese were more
          positive than negative, especially when compared with previous years.
          These more positive policies worked to the advantage of those who
          arrived in the Philippines at mid-19th century as Lim Cong Jap
          apparently did.
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost from the beginning of their rule, the Spanish needed the
          skilled Chinese workers for virtually all the work done in Manila.
          Without them, they would not have had their luxurious colonial
          lifestyle. At that stage, the Spanish believed that the indios, who
          were still primarily engaged in agricultural and fishing activities,
          did not yet have the business expertise that the Chinese artisans and
          traders had. This was another reason that mestizo and indio parents
          desired Chinese husbands for their daughters because the Chinese
          having more business training and experience had more opportunities
          for employment and would provide better for their daughters and their
          eventual offspring.
        </p>

        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, by mid-19th century, the Chinese controlled much
          of the business sector. By the 1840s, the Philippine Chinese were
          exporting products that included rice, tobacco, and cotton, mahogany,
          abaca, and indigo. By the 1850s, exports also included coffee, sugar,
          and coconut oil and increased exports of other products. Therefore,
          the export trade greatly expanded. The years 1850 to 1896 were years
          of phenomenal change and economic growth in the Philippines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chinese began to start their own trading firms and by doing that
          created the beginnings of their later virtual monopolies in
          commodities trading. The Philippine economy was expanding through its
          export trade. For example, hemp in which Joaquin traded, was the
          Philippine's largest export crop in the 19th century, when it was
          heavily used for cordage and ship's riggings.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were not enough banks to assist farmers. Joaquin began his
          business by making crop loans on agricultural products much in demand
          for export. Like the foreign traders, Joaquin, and other Chinese who
          invested in this manner, spurred growth in agriculture and in exports.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Wickberg has written, Joaquin also became a trader in the lucrative
          sugar and tobacco commodities. He probably dealt in other agricultural
          commodities as well. At some point, Joaquin founded the Siu Liong
          Company, trading firm, to handle this business. He was involved in
          this trading during a time of incredible booms and became very
          prosperous. Sui Liong also provided marine insurance, not through a
          formal type of insurance company, but by making advances on the
          cargoes that they traded on and taking some sort of risk in the
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't know very much about Policarpia's life, however we will try
          to get more information about her from the Nolascos from Cebu. In
          addition to raising her children, it's possible that she had some
          business interests of her own and/or had received an inheritance since
          she left quite a large inheritance when she died at the relatively
          young age of 44 in 1875.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano was 19 when she died. As the "<span class="em">Kuya</span>",
          no doubt he helped guide his younger brothers as they grew up without
          their mother. Incidentally, the Filipino custom of designating
          children by their order in the family, such as
          <span class="em">Kuya, Ate, Diche, etc</span>. is derived from the
          Chinese designating children by their order from the Chinese.
        </p>

        <p>
          Joaquin was involved in serving his community, and became a respected
          community leader, who was involved with many charitable activities,
          including the Chinese Charitable Association, already noted.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Wickberg's information, in 1886 Joaquin was one of only
          four top businessmen from Manila who traveled to Hong Kong to present
          a petition to the Chinese Ambassador to Spain, Chang Yin-huan, who was
          passing by Hong Kong on his way to his post.
        </p>

        <p>
          This indicates that Joaquin was one of the most esteemed and most
          influential businessmen of his community. The petition requested that
          a Chinese consulate be established in Manila. There were thousands of
          Chinese nationals working in the Philippines, but no Chinese officials
          to assist them. Their petition was eventually granted and
          establishment of this consulate was an important event for the
          Philippine Government as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite Joaquin's success and assimilation in the Philippines, the
          deeply held belief among his generation was that, no matter how long
          they had lived abroad, they must return to China in order to die on
          Chinese soil. At an early retirement age, Joaquin apparently left his
          business interests in the hands of Mariano and returned to China to
          retire.
        </p>

        <p>
          He bought a large house (30-40 rooms) and was well settled into the
          foreign settlement area on Kulangsu (now Gulangyu) Island, off Amoy,
          now Xiamen where consulates were located. Like Shanghai's
          international settlement area, Kulangsu was also a European-influenced
          foreign business community, composed of a sophisticated, elite class
          which was used to an opulent lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fittingly, Joaquin Barrera Limjap, who had lived a cosmopolitan adult
          lifestyle died in the international enclave on Kulangsu Island. He was
          56 years of age when he died on the last day of January in 1888. At
          some later point, his bones were brought back by his grandsons to
          Manila and placed in the Limjap Chapel, North Cemetery, which Mariano
          had constructed in 1913. According to several printed sources, Antonio
          Osorio, described as the richest man in Cavite Province at that time
          and who had once been a business associate of Joaquin's, bought out
          his business interests after his death.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although we lack so much information about his life, it's easy to see
          that Joaquin succeeded in every way. He had left China with little
          financially and had become a top business leader in the Philippines.
          He had become a Catholic, had married and started a family. He was a
          respected community leader who had conducted his life with integrity
          and honor. He had served God, his community, and his nation well.
          Finally, as his parents would have wished, he had returned to China so
          that he could die on Chinese soil.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to all his accomplishments, Joaquin succeeded in achieving
          one thing that no one else in the world had ever achieved before or
          could achieve afterwards - he became the first
          <span class="bold">LIMJAP</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          By doing that, he had also started the "<span class="bold"
            >House of Limjap</span
          >".

      <article class="content">
        <h1>Chapter 4: Mariano's Education And Career</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">M</span>ost written sources state that
          Mariano's basic education was obtained from his father. These appear
          to have been taken from Mariano's biography published in the
          Dictionary of Philippine Biography (DPB), Volume I. The information
          for that bio was provided by his children Leonarda and Francisco and
          would seem to be conclusive.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, among Mariano's contemporaries, it was getting to be more
          usual to attend either Letran or Ateneo or both, although not
          necessarily to graduate. Many prominent Chinese mestizo families also
          employed private tutors for their children. A private tutor could have
          provided a very good education. Possibly Mariano, Jacinto and Apolonio
          followed this path and their children didn't think it important enough
          to mention if they did not graduate.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must remember that a college degree was not in any way a necessity
          in the 19th century. That's an idea more common to the 20th century.
          After all, even some early American presidents did not attend or did
          not graduate from college. At any rate, the Philippine university
          educational curriculum at that time was at best very limited,
          something which the reformists later on would seek to improve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Definitely, the generation after Mariano's generation had many more
          options. Besides studying at U.S.T., many went to Europe for their
          education. For example, Mariano's sons, Marianito, Gregorio, Jose,
          Francisco, and a nephew, Agapito Escolar, all attended schools in
          London, and some also in the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if they did attend school, Mariano's generation of Chinese
          mestizos often also worked in family firms as well. We know that
          Mariano began by working for his father. Probably Jacinto did as well.
          In the 19th century, it was the custom around most of the world for
          young men to work in a family firm, learning all the ropes in an
          informal sort of apprenticeship. Having learned the basics from his
          father, Mariano was probably eager to get more involved in the company
          once he was in his teens. Joaquin was a very successful import-export
          trader and could have taught his sons everything they needed to know
          about business. Obviously, Mariano learned his lessons well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost every writer who has written about him mentions Mariano's
          numerous business interests, his blue-chip investments, his pioneering
          efforts in various fields of Philippine business. Yet few give us
          complete information.
        </p>

            <img src="./i/ch-04-01.jpg" />
            <p>The ever well-dressed Mariano taken when he was much younger.</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In the Index of Vol. I of the DPB, Mariano is listed as one of the
          leading business people of the time with ten other businessmen and
          with one businesswoman, Margarita Roxas Ayala. Out of all the people
          the author Esperidion Arsenio Manuel interviewed and wrote about for
          that volume, only twelve are listed under this category. That, in
          itself, is significant and shows that Mariano was among the top
          Philippine business people then.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also interesting to note that, once again, Mariano is included
          there with fellow businessmen Telesforo Chuidian and Luis Yangco. Time
          and time again, the three of them were involved together in various
          undertakings as we will see in subsequent chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          From Mariano's 1922 will, we have learned that he inherited assets, in
          similar large amounts, from both his father and his mother. Although
          we don't know if the two events are related from his will, we also
          know that Joaquin died in January 1888, and that, by February or March
          of 1888, Mariano started Limjap y Cia. At some point, he established
          an Iloilo branch office. It is confirmed from various other sources
          that, by 1890 or earlier, Mariano had established an independent
          company and was a participant in the Philippines' rapidly expanding
          importing and exporting trade, trading in the commodities that had
          made his father a fortune. That early, Mariano was already involved in
          international trade.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wickberg, who did extensive research on the Philippine Chinese
          mestizos, further confirms this, and provides us information about
          Limjap y Cia's pioneering work involving the lucrative marine
          insurance business, previously only handled by the foreign trading
          companies. He states in his book,
          <span class="em"> The Chinese in Philippine Life - 1850-1898:</span>
        </p>

        <p class="em">
          "The foreign trade of the Philippine Chinese had changed in another
          way by the 1890s. By 1891 (and possibly earlier than that) a Chinese
          owned marine insurance firm in Hong Kong had established an agency in
          Manila. By the turn of the century some of the most important Chinese
          and mestizo commission agent firms in Manila were acting as agents of
          other Hong Kong insurance firms....Limjap and Company, a commission
          house operated by the mestizo sons of Joaquin Barrera Limjap, besides
          being agent for Penang Khean Guan Insurance Company, Ltd., represented
          Po On and Chai On Marine Insurance Companies of Hong Kong."
        </p>

        <p>
          From this we can see that Jacinto was also involved in Limjap y Cia.
          We don't yet know if Limjap y Cia continued in the same manner after
          the Philippine-American War.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1903 at least, the business for Penang Khean Guan Marine Insurance
          Company, Ltd. was still being conducted from Mariano's office at 12
          Hormiga Street, Binondo.
        </p>

        <p>
          Except for the period of his imprisonment and the war years, Mariano
          continually prospered. It seems that he had unique vision and
          decisiveness, attributes that allowed him not just to cope with the
          economic changes of the 19th and 20th centuries but to seize business
          opportunities created by the changes. For example, when trading in
          agricultural commodities was no longer profitable for Chinese
          mestizos, he appears to have been out of it and into new ventures.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the Philippine-American War ended, Mariano saw the need for real
          estate development and was one of the Philippine's earliest real
          estate developers. Additionally, we know from various printed sources
          that he was an early investor in new firms that have since become
          major Philippine corporations, such as San Miguel Corporation,
          Filipinas Compania de Seguros, now part of Ayala's FGU Group, and
          China Banking Corporation. San Miguel was founded in 1890. Filipinas
          was organized in 1913, at an initial subscription of P277,000, with
          its incorporators being members of prominent Manila families. China
          Bank was founded in 1920.

        <p>
          From 1908 to 1913, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the
          Bank of the Philippine Islands. Since he was a Director of the first
          BPI Board under its re-chartering of 1907, he is often said to be a
          founder of the BPI. Of course, the BPI a formerly the Banco Espanol
          Filipino, first established in 1851.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many printed sources have indicated that Mariano was also a heavy
          investor of the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation.
        </p>

        <p>
          He pursued agricultural development by buying rice plantations and
          rice mills in Nueva Ecija, later left to his sons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano had numerous other businesses and interests, including La
          Perla Tobacco Company.
        </p>

        <p>
          While a sawmill may not sound as impressive as Manila's banking and
          manufacturing sectors, actually it must have been quite profitable.
          It's noteworthy that in 1903 only 14 sawmills were operating in all of
          the Philippines, and this was at a period when construction was
          beginning to boom. By 1930, there were 90, which again shows the
          wisdom of Mariano's business decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may never know the extent of his business interests and
          investments. Naturally, over the years, numerous other business
          interests were bought and sold. For example, we know when the
          inheritance taxes were due after Mariano's death, the Limjap family
          decided it more prudent to hold onto real property and instead to sell
          Mariano's large share of San Miguel stocks.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's unclear what Mariano's business activities were in the years
          before his death. Monching Osmena remembers when he was about two
          years old sitting on his Lolo Mariano's lap while Mariano was in a
          wheel chair. So, obviously, he was ill, but we don't know from what.
          Perhaps by then, he was retired or semi-retired. He could have also
          worked from his home since, even during the Philippine Revolution and
          probably before, he also had an office set up there, one which his
          older grandchildren remember well. During the Revolution, he had two
          telephones, numbers 104 and 181, and a telegraph address,
          "Limjap-Manila". This we have from his letterhead on a letter he wrote
          on November 26, 1898.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of his life, his business reputation was, and had long
          been, very secure. His business acumen was respected and his
          prosperity was well known. He had pioneered in major sectors of the
          economy and was one of the top business leaders of the nation.
          However, Mariano was more than a business leader. He was a family man
          who also became a patriot.

          <span class="big-letter">F</span>rom his will, we know that Mariano's
          first wife was Dona Juana Siaosingco. She was born in 1858, two years
          after he was born, and she died on February 23, 1885, at age 27. A
          memorial tablet for her has been placed in the Limjap Chapel at North
          Cemetery.
        </p>

        <p>
          They had three children who died before age three. As he lists them in
          his 1922 will, they were Maria Narcisa Limjap y Siaosingco, Joaquin
          Maria Bernabe Limjap y Siaosingco, and Eusebio Andres Limjap y
          Siaosingco. Thankfully, two other children, Marianito and Gregorio had
          long and healthy lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't know the cause of the other children's deaths but Manila had
          many, many epidemics in the 19th century and the mortality rate for
          children was exceedingly high. At that time, women frequently died in
          childbirth as well. Mariano's second wife, Maria Escolar Cochay, loved
          all the children and grandchildren as her own and is now known fondly
          to all the Limjap family as their Lola Angoy.

          Maria's parents were Ildefonsa Carreon and Pedro Escolar Cochay. It's
          likely that her mother was a Spanish mestiza and her father a Chinese
          mestizo. One family member remembers that the Escolar-Cochays were
          considered wealthy, perhaps even more so than the Limjaps, or at least
          initially. At any rate, they must have been from the same social
          strata. Otherwise, their marriage would not have been allowed. Since
          Maria later had a prosperous casco boat business, it's possible she
          inherited that from her father. The casco boat business was then a
          very lucrative one. Almost all goods were brought from Manila port to
          other areas via the Pasig River and the numerous esteros, resulting in
          a virtual non-stop delivery service. Her mother was born in 1842 and
          her father in 1825, thus, there was a difference of 17 years between
          their ages. Maria, an only child, was born in 1865.
        </p>

        <p>
          She and Mariano were married on May 2, 1886. Their early years of
          married life must have been bittersweet when their first two children
          died in infancy and their fourth child died at age two. Again, from
          Mariano's will, we learn that the eldest was Josefa Hermenegilda who
          was born April, 3 1888, and, died that year on December 22, 1888.
          Manuel Apolonio Domingo was born July 23, 1889, and, also, died the
          same year in November 3, 1889. Leonarda Rufina was born in 1890. About
          one year later in November 18, 1891, Maria Isabel was born and, sad to
          say, she died on November 5, 1893. Their first Christmases, in
          particular, must have been sad ones indeed for the young married
          couple. However, what a joy it must have been for them when they knew
          Leonarda was healthy and that, at last, they had the beginnings of the
          rest of their family, the Limjaps y Escolar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jose Gonzalo Joaquin was born in 1892, Maria Esperanza in 1894,
          Joaquina Pacienca in 1896, Francisco Isabelo in 1898, Felisa
          Encarnacion at the turn of the century in January 1900, and the
          youngest Pedro Arsenio in 1902.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1889, three years after Maria and Mariano married, Mariano's
          youngest brother, Apolonio, died at age 20, So far, unfortunately,
          we've discovered nothing else about Apolonio.

          <span class="big-letter">A</span>s we've seen, initially, the two
          brothers Limjap apparently worked together but it seems that later on
          they took different career paths, perhaps after the
          Philippine-American War. Jacinto became involved in livestock
          breeding, which became more important during the early American era.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, we have learned that Jacinto was asked to give fund to the
          Cuerpo Compromisarios, that in 1896 he and Mariano donated a million
          pesos to fund the Manila battalion and that they were both imprisoned
          by the Spanish. We also know that Jacinto was appointed as tax
          collector for the Revolutionary Government and that this was a
          sensitive post, which was given to prominent persons who were also
          trustworthy. It's very likely that the Spanish authorities confiscated
          his property and froze his assets after they arrested him in 1896.
          Some of the properties that were confiscated then were not returned
          until after the Philippine-American War.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's obvious that Jacinto freely gave of himself and his financial
          resources to his country during those difficult times. When he agreed
          to serve as one of the tax collectors for the revolutionary
          government, he took on an important task. The new government needed
          the revenue to help fund its activities. Since some of the tax
          collection records have been catalogued in the National Archives, we
          have hopes of eventually getting more details on Jacinto's
          contributions to this very necessary endeavor. The people throughout
          the country supported the Revolution and the Philippine American War
          and, apparently, wholeheartedly paid their taxes and license fees.
          However, someone had to be willing to go out, to collect, and to turn
          them over to the Treasury. There were definite risks involved in that.

        <p>
          Most reference books discovered so far mention more details about
          Mariano than about Jacinto. Unfortunately, there is still so much we
          don't know and we can only hope that future research will provide more
          details of his life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luckily, we received the following information from Nahum Limjap, a
          grandson of Jacinto. This has helped us to learn more about Jacinto
          and his family. Nahum was seven and his brother Joaquin was nine when
          their Lolo Jacinto died. However, over the years, they heard many
          family stories about Jacinto, which are included here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nahum wrote that his Lolo Jacinto was a very loving, thoughtful,
          generous and charitable person to his family and to his employees.
          Jacinto was a popular man. As he walked the streets of Carriedo each
          day, everybody would be greeting him. In the fashion of the day, he
          was, of course, known as Don Jacinto.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jacinto married Clotilde Alonzo, a daughter of a jeweler from Santa
          Cruz, who, according to their family's unwritten history, was a
          relative of Dr. Jose Rizal through his mother, Mrs. Teodora Alonzo
          Rizal who came from a prominent family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nahum remembers that, until 1949, his mother kept wooden dolls which
          he understands were carved by Dr. Rizal while he was in exile in
          Dapitan. From printed sources, we have read of several instances of
          Dr. Rizal giving his carvings away to those friends and family for
          whom he cared the most.
        </p>

        <figure class="sm-img-figure left">

        <p>
          The Jacinto Limjaps had one son, German, and they lived for a long
          time in a large house in Santa Cruz District on the corner of Sales
          Street and Estero Cegado. The house had two entrances, one on each
          side. Lolo Jacinto was a good provider to his family and he lived the
          lifestyle of the rich man he was. German married Paz del Prado and
          they had two sons, Joaquin and Nahum. German and his family lived in
          their ancestral home until 1924.
        </p>

        <p>
          Awards given to Jacinto, which they still have, indicate he was one of
          the top livestock breeders during the early American era, and was
          therefore a pioneer in that field. During the Philippine Expositions
          of 1912 and 1914, the U.S. Government awarded him five awards. In
          1912, he was presented the First Prize and Gold Medal for Imported
          Dairy Bulls, Second Prize and Bronze Medal for Foreign Breed, Native
          Bred Cows, and First Prize and Gold Medal Foreign Breed, Native Bred
          Bulls, Foreign Breed, Native Bred Heifers, and active Cows. In 1914,
          Jacinto was given two awards for recognition of his services as a
          Committee Member on Live Stock Exhibits at the Philippine Exposition
          of 1914.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jacinto also owned a stable and employed many "cocheros". Cocheros
          were used as the drivers of caratellas, so, apparently, Jacinto also
          had a caratella business.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jacinto had a big heart for the poorer people and was very close to
          the masses, whom he loved. He knew by name many of the tough guys and
          beggars that plied their trade on the streets near Quiapo Church. Once
          he was a victim of a pickpocket who ran away with his gold watch. The
          next day, he was surprised by the leader of the pickpockets who came
          to return the watch and who apologized to him.

          Lolo Jacinto was a very religious man, who attended mass every day and
          who was a generous contributor to many churches in Quiapo and
          Intramuros. At one church the priest would not start the mass until
          Don Jacinto arrived. Even when the church was closed, if Jacinto
          arrived and knocked on the door with his cane, the parish priest would
          open the door and start the mass instantly.

          However, Nahum notes that while Jacinto was religious he was also
          human, and was a regular guy whose amusements were hunting,
          cockfighting and gambling. He often went to Marikina for hunting and
          cockfighting. Jacinto kept close family ties, and a Nahum remembers
          his Lolo taking him to have Sunday family lunches with his Kuya
          Mariano, or Lolo "Nano" to Nahum, and Lola Angoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a sad day for the Limjaps and especially for Nahum's family
          when their Lolo Jacinto died from heart disease at the San Juan de
          Dios Hospital, then in Intramuros, on December 7, 1923.

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">L</span>ike his father, Mariano was always
          interested in helping his community and his nation. He followed in
          Joaquin's footsteps, but he also made strides of his own. As an adult,
          Mariano was involved in many facets of Manila life. The DPB's Index
          also lists Mariano as one of four philanthropists from his age. The
          other three listed were Margarita Roxas de Ayala, Benigno Cui and
          Pedro Cui.
        </p>

        <p>
          He served his community as Cabeza de Barangay and as Gobernadorcillo
          in Binondo. The Cabeza de Barangay served as a liaison between his
          community and the Spanish authorities. He also collected taxes, made
          various administrative reports, helped maintain order in his
          community, and was expected to encourage good moral behavior among his
          constituents. He was given two assistants to help him. The
          Gobernadorcillo reported to the Provincial Governor and was
          responsible for settling petty disputes and for his community's timely
          tax payments. Gobernadorcillos were also called "Capitan", and in
          Binondo in the late 1800s the position was an esteemed and powerful
          one. Since the Gobernadorcillos had to bear the costs of their
          official expenses which always exceeded their nominal salary, wealthy
          persons were preferred to avoid extortion by office holders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like Joaquin, Mariano was concerned for those in need. One of the ways
          he helped was by supporting many poor students who had potential and
          who wanted to pursue professional studies. These he sent to the
          University of the Philippines and other schools, providing all
          expenses, free tuition, fees, board and lodging and other incidental
          expenses. His only condition was that the student did not fail in any
          of his subjects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The recipients of his scholarships included Buenaventura Adriano, in
          Commerce, Liceo de Manila; Amado Javier, in Commerce, Jose Rizal
          College; Pacifico Javier, Pedro Baello, Pharmacy Medicine; Eulalio
          Adriano, in Commerce; Arsenio Nolasco, in Commerce; Agapito Escolar in
          London; Cesario Santa Ana, in Medicine, University of the Philippines;
          Jesus Perlas, in Engineering, University of the Philippines; Miguel
          Manresa, in Veterinary Science, University of the Philippines; and
          Fedelino Rodriguez, in Engineering, University of the Philippines.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Mariano's civic contributions, in 1895 the Spanish Government
          honored him by awarding him the distinction of Caballero de la Real
          Orden Americana de Isabel La Catolica. Not surprisingly, Telesforo
          Chuidian was a fellow awardee. Less than a year after that, they were
          both arrested by the Spanish.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early American era, he served on the Rizal Monument Commission.
          Tomas G. del Rosario was the Commission's president until his death.
          After that, Teodoro Yangco replaced del Rosario as president. Other
          commission members were Juan Tecson, Pascual Poblete, Paciano Rizal,
          Maximina Paterno (who was arrested with Mariano by the Spanish), and
          Ramon Genato.
        </p>

        <p>
          The monument was erected in the Luneta near the spot of Rizal's
          execution and is now the national monument of the Philippines. Rizal's
          poignant farewell poem, "Ultimo Mi Dios" is inscribed in Spanish,
          Tagalog and English and on another side the names of those who worked
          for establishment of the monument are listed, including Mariano's.
          Today, world leaders pay their respects to the Philippine national
          hero Dr. Jose Rizal by laying their country's memorial wreaths there
          immediately after arriving in Manila for their official visits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apparently, Mariano honored Dr. Rizal in another way, one seldom
          mentioned. In 1898, Mariano, Martin Ocampo and others were founding
          patrons of the Orquesta Rizal, obviously named in honor of Dr. Rizal.
          Jose A. Estella was its director. We don't know if this orchestra was
          revived after the war years.

          Mariano was also a patron of the fine arts, and he collected many fine
          paintings, including some important ones that were painted by
          Philippine masters. In his collection, there were a number of Juan
          Luna's paintings, including "The Harvesting of Rice". Another of the
          Luna paintings owned by Mariano was "Haycutters", which is not often
          mentioned in printed sources. This was a painting showing a scene in a
          rural area of what is now Rizal Province. It has been noted that,
          while most of Luna's paintings show the influence of French
          impressionism, "Haycutters" had a distinct Luna originality. Among the
          collection were Fabian de Ia Rosa's painting, "Rice Planting", and
          Resurreccion Hidalgo's "Bosque de Bolonia" and "Primavera".
          "Primavera" won the first place in the 1903-1904 St. Louis Exposition.
          The painting was bequeathed to Mariano's son Pedro and his daughter,
          Connie Limjap Lichauco, vividly remembers this painting because the
          eyes of the figure which represented "Spring" seemed to follow the
          viewer from any direction. According to family members, these
          exquisite, priceless paintings were stored in the National Archives
          during the Japanese occupation in World War II, and were,
          unfortunately, burned during the liberation of Manila in February
          1945.

          While obviously the Limjaps appreciated the art of these Philippine
          masterpieces, the fact that many of the artists had also been involved
          in the Philippines' struggle for freedom was, without a doubt, of much
          more significance. Juan Luna, of course, was imprisoned by the Spanish
          with Mariano in Fort Santiago.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1925, Guillermo Tolentino sculpted a marble bust of Mariano and, in
          1926, a marble bust of Lola Angoy. The busts survived World War II and
          are still in the family's possession. Tolentino also sculpted eleven
          bronze statues of Lolo Mariano, which were given to his children. Each
          statue is about one foot high, and shows Lolo Mariano standing, with a
          cane in his hand. Most of the statues are still in the family,
          although we heard that one is no longer with the family after it was
          offered for sale at a rather large amount. In 1973, Tolentino was
          awarded the designation of Philippine National Artist.

        <p>
          Even at the Limjap Chapel in North Cemetery, the Limjaps' appreciation
          for fine artistry is clear. In addition to the handsome architecture
          of the chapel itself, Mariano imported five stained glass windows from
          France. Two are on each side and a larger one is behind the altar.
          They are signed "L. Collinet - Peintre. Verrie-Paris".
        </p>

        <p>
          The Limjaps frequently traveled. Unfortunately, we don't have much
          information on their various trips. One that is noted in several
          write-ups is their European trip of 1893. Elpi Valencia, in his book
          entitled President Sergio Osmena, wrote that Don Mariano was one of
          the most traveled persons of his time. We can only assume that besides
          European trips, they traveled to Hong Kong, where Mariano had business
          connections, and to Amoy (Xiamen) where the Limjaps had a house.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Limjaps were among Manila's social leaders. Many sources mention
          the Limjaps' weekly soirees where hundreds of guests were entertained
          and at which Manila's best orchestras often played.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Limjap mansion on Calle Echague was constructed before the
          Revolution. This was in the San Miguel District, then the most elegant
          neighborhood of Manila. The houses of the Roxases and the Sorianos on
          General Solano Street were across the street which led up to Ayala
          Bridge. The Limjaps' residence had a boat landing for guests who
          wanted to arrive by private boat or to fish in the unpolluted Pasig
          River. Of course, Malacanang was practically around the corner, and in
          the same neighborhood were houses of other prominent families. Later
          on, the Jose Gonzalo Limjaps resided on Aviles Street.

        <p>
          Many sources report that the three-story Limjap house was palatial,
          its European and Chinese furnishings elegant and its art collection
          priceless. The house fronted Calle Echague and continued all the way
          to the Pasig River. It has been said that when hundreds of guests
          dined at the Limjaps, they were served on the best porcelain, silver
          and crystal from Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
          One family member recalls seeing man-size porcelain Chinese vases as
          being among the many exquisite decorative items. Almost as soon as
          modern conveniences were invented, they were added to the household.
          There was a swimming pool, a small bowling alley, a basketball court
          in an area which was the size of two basketball courts.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to its fine furnishings and paintings, the Limjaps also
          hired Toribio Antillion, who was then the Philippines' foremost
          decorative and scenographic painter to paint murals. Antillion also
          decorated the interiors of the houses of Joaquin Inchausti, Gregorio
          Araneta, Moreno Lacalle, Arcadio Arellano, Eduardo Litongjua, Ireneo
          Felix, Ildefonso Tambunting, Felipe R. Hidalgo, and many others.
          Apparently, Antillion had an extraordinary command of perspective, and
          was adept at the art of aquarelle, or drawing in transparent
          watercolors.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one knew it then, but the fate of the San Miguel house would be
          sealed from the moment the Japanese occupied it in World War II. The
          Japanese established a shipyard in the back of the property that
          opened into the Pasig River and their Navy office in the house. When
          the Americans returned, the Japanese decided to destroy the shipyard
          and the house, rather than leave it for the Americans. First, they
          tried to burn them but the durable residence constructed of marble and
          of the hardest of woods would not burn. The Japanese then laid
          dynamite and blew up the shipyard and the house. Unfortunately, the
          grand old house, an architectural treasure that had survived
          earthquakes, other natural calamities, and an earlier war, was totally
          destroyed.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the prosperous and socially active early 1890s, no one could
          have imagined the 20th century wars that would follow nor of another
          one so near, a revolutionary period that would change their lives and
          their nation forever. But, events were unfolding that soon would bring
          the lilting music of the 1890s to a sudden halt.

        <h1>Chapter 8: Turning Point: The Spanish Arrests</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">L</span>ike the Philippines itself, from.
          mid-1896 into 1900, Mariano and his family, were involved in a period
          of terrible turmoil. To better understand some small part of what they
          must have endured during the pre-Revolutionary period, the subsequent
          Revolution, and the Philippine-American War that followed that, some
          basic historical facts are included here together with some of the
          Limjap's contributions in this era.
        </p>

        <p>
          There had been discrimination, conflicts, uprisings, and revolts
          through the centuries of Spanish rule which slowly convinced most of
          the non-Spaniards in the Philippines that changes were needed.
          However, most historians cite the January 1872 Cavite Mutiny and
          subsequent Spanish executions of the three priests, Father Jose
          Burgos, Father Mariano Gomez and Father Jacinto Zamora, as the
          catalyst that led, first, to movements seeking reforms from Spain and,
          later, to those seeking complete independence. The execution of the
          priests was extremely shocking to the public and was enough to
          convince many that change was needed. Mariano would have been 15 years
          old in January, 1872 and old enough for these events to have made a
          deep impression on him.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the 1880s, the reformists were busy informing people in the
          Philippines and abroad about proposed reforms. A number of sources
          state that it was the Chinese community, particularly the mestizos,
          who could afford to back the propaganda movement. Roman Ongpin was
          providing much assistance to those involved in the propaganda movement
          in the Philippines. He allowed his store, El 82, to be used as a
          center for distribution of pamphlets. He also contributed heavily to
          the propaganda movement and later to the war efforts. If the Spanish
          suspected the areas of Binondo, Santa Cruz, Tondo, and surrounding
          areas were hot beds of revolution, they were right.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a booklet provided by Chit Boncan Herbosa, we have learned that
          Mariano was one of the financiers of La Liga Filipina, which Dr. Jose
          Rizal organized in 1892. The members first met in the home of a
          Chinese, Dorotea Ongjunco, at 176 Ilaya Street, Binondo. Telesforo
          Chuidian and Luis Yangco are also listed as Liga financier together
          with other Chinese mestizos that included Antonio and Juan Luna,
          Felipe Zamora, Pedro and Francisco Roxas, Eduardo Litonjua, Marcelino
          de los Santos, Maximina Paterno, Isaac F. Rios and Nazario
          Constantino. This group must have been one of close friends and family
          because such activities were dangerous and those involved had to know
          that they could trust each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't have any written information about Mariano's political
          beliefs but we know that, by supporting the Liga, he was a supporter
          of Dr. Rizal. That is bolstered by the fact that later he helped to
          raise funds for the Rizal Monument, that he named an orchestra in
          honor of Dr. Rizal, and that as a founding member of Club Filipino, he
          honored Dr. Rizal on his death anniversary by wearing black even when
          it was ill-advised to do so. Initially at least, it seems he was in
          favor of seeking reforms from Spain, rather than outright revolution.
          Additionally, as mentioned earlier, his brother Jacinto was married to
          Clotilde Alonzo, who was related to Dr. Rizal's mother.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Spanish authorities, who were already watching everything that Dr.
          Jose Rizal did, now began to watch those around him, including the
          Liga members who were also put under surveillance. Then, also within
          June, Dr. Rizal was sent into exile at Dapitan. From there, he still
          was able to keep in touch; however, without him, La Liga fell into
          disarray.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two groups were then formed from the Liga. Those who desired to
          continue to press for reforms formed the Cuerpo de Compromisarios and
          those who felt revolution was now the only way joined the Katipunan.
          We don't know if Mariano or Jacinto joined the Compromisarios.
          However, it seems clear they did not join the Katipunan. The
          Katipunan, which needed funds, tried to get Liga members to join their
          organization, but most sources state they were not very successful in
          this.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Compromisarios, of course, also needed funds. T.A. Agoncillo wrote
          that "Ariston Bautista Lin, Domingo Franco, Telesforo Chuidian,
          Jacinto Limjap, Felipe Barreto and others were prevailed upon to give
          their support to the new association." While we don't have any
          confirmation in writing that Jacinto or Mariano donated funds to the
          Compromisarios the odds are that the Limjaps, and probably others in
          their peer group, did provide the requested funds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most sources state that La Liga's members were from the well-to-do or
          the aristocracy, that the Cuerpo Compromisarios were from the middle
          class, and the Katipunan were from the largest group, the masses.
          Still, this may be too simplistic since there were crossovers in all
          groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then events occurred at such a rapid pace that soon almost everyone,
          regardless of personal affiliations or ideology, was affected. During
          the last week of August 1896, the first Katipunan uprisings occurred.
          Unfortunately for him, Dr. Rizal arrived in Manila around this time
          from Dapitan. He was on his way to work as a doctor in the yellow
          fever epidemic in Cuba. His enemies accused him of plotting the
          uprisings, but eventually he was permitted to leave Manila.
        </p>

        <p>
          On September 12th, Francisco Osorio' a son of Joaquin's friend and
          former business associate Antonio Osorio, was executed by the Spanish
          in Cavite. He and the other twelve persons, now known as the Thirteen
          Martyrs of Cavite were all Chinese mestizos. On September 15, Mariano
          and Jacinto donated what was then "a staggering one million pesos for
          the battalion of Manila volunteers!"
        </p>

        <p>
          On the next evening, September 16, 1896, Mariano and Jacinto were
          arrested by the Spanish authorities. T.M. Kalaw has written that
          Mariano and 21 other members of the Philippine elite, including
          Telesforo Chuidian and Luis Yangco, "well known for their wealth,
          culture, and social position, were also thrown into prison and
          tortured." Kalaw described Chuidian as "a rich merchant, popular in
          the exclusive social set of his day, whose hospitality and
          entertainments were known to Spaniards of every description." Kalaw
          also wrote that "Mariano Limjap, [was] another rich merchant, no less
          hospitable than the former. His palatial home was always open to his
          Spanish friends. He also held responsible positions in the Filipino
          Government."
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Kalaw, the other nineteen persons who were arrested with
          them on that day were: Lorenzo del Rosario, Pedro Casimiro, Ambrosio
          Salvador, Bonifacio Arevalo, Maximo Paterno, Ambrosio
          Rianzares-Bautista, Nazario Constantino, Antonio Salazar, Juan Luna,
          Dr. Jose Luna, Antonio Luna, Isidro Soto Villaruel, Dr. Felipe Zamora,
          Numeriano Adriano, Ambrosio Flores, Dr. Jose Albert, Isaac Fernando
          Rios, Marcelino de los Santos, and Rosario Villaruel, the Liga, and 3
          were Masons. At least 8 subsequently became founders or members of
          Club Filipino.
        </p>

        <p>
          T.A. Agoncillo's list is similar but he includes Jacinto Limjap and
          Eduardo Litonjua as two others who were also arrested that day.
          Agoncillo also notes that those on his list included a painter, a
          dentist, a pharmacist, lawyers, physicians, a shipping magnate
          (Yangco), and businessmen (including Chuidian and the Limjaps).
        </p>

        <p>
          What has since been called the "Spanish Reign of Terror" followed the
          uprising. Hundreds and hundreds of others were added to those already
          arrested, including prominent citizens from most towns on Luzon. The
          small Fort Santiago immediately became overcrowded to the point where
          it was exceedingly unsanitary.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Spanish froze assets and confiscated properties of those suspected
          of being katipuneros. Since Mariano and Jacinto were arrested on
          suspicion of being involved with the Katipunan Uprising, even if they
          were not, it's likely their properties were confiscated and their bank
          accounts were frozen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why were they arrested if they were supporters of La Liga and not of
          the Katipunan? According to Club Filipino's history, Fountain of Gold,
          by Felice Sta. Maria, Andres Bonifacio purposely left behind a list of
          elite members' names from whom the Katipunan had been trying to
          solicit funds. Some believe Bonifacio did this to divert attention
          from himself; others feel he did this to get the mestizos to commit to
          revolution. In any event, Mariano and Jacinto had funded the Manila
          battalion, so even if they were not Katipunan members, that would have
          made them the enemy of the Spanish regime.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reign of terror escalated. By now other prisons were overcrowded
          as well. Prisoners were subjected to some of the cruelest forms of
          torture. Mock trials were held. Public executions were held so often
          that soon even the Spanish civilian population could not tolerate
          them. The Spanish then began executing prisoners privately inside the
          prisons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Rizal did not reach Cuba, but was returned to Manila. He arrived
          in Manila on November 3. His summary court-martial began on December
          16. At dawn, on December 30, 1896, Dr. Jose Rizal was executed by the
          Spanish.
        </p>

        <p>
          We cannot even begin to imagine the thoughts of Mariano and Jacinto
          who were still being held in Fort Santiago. This had to have been a
          somber, sad time especially for supporters of Dr. Rizal.
        </p>

        <p>
          On January 11, 1897, other prisoners, some Liga members included, were
          executed. Numeriano Adriano, who had been arrested with Don Mariano,
          was one of those executed on that day, as were millionaire Francisco
          Roxas and Faustino Villaruel who was the father of Rosario. Adriano
          was also the brother-in-law of Francisco Osorio.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those remaining in prison must have been devastated, and this period
          must have been one of deep reflection. During his imprisonment by the
          Spanish, Juan Luna painted his "Ecce Homo", referred to as "a sublime
          painting of Christ." In the months of detention, many had died from
          malnutrition. Hundreds had suffocated. Some guards accepted bribes and
          permitted prisoners brief periods in relatively less crowded area. But
          at night, everyone was again packed in like sardines, often only able
          to stand but not to lie down to sleep. Some of those who managed to
          survive the imprisonment caught illnesses in Fort Santiago that caused
          their early deaths. According to his DPB bio, Telesforo Chuidian
          contracted tuberculosis of the larynx there where he was imprisoned
          for about six months. He died in 1903, at age 48.
        </p>

        <p>
          To survive one day meant that there was some hope that they would be
          alive the next. Still, as the months dragged on, things must have
          looked pretty bleak for those still in prison.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano and Luis R. Yangco were finally released on March 29, 1897, or
          a little over six months after their arrest. We can only assume
          Jacinto served a similar sentence. Juan Luna was in prison for over
          eight months. He was released by a pardon on May 27, 1897 which was
          the birth anniversary of King Alfonso XIII. That seems to have been a
          general pardon when others may have been released as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't know what Lola Angoy went through during this period, but it
          must have been a terrible time of anxiety and adversity for her and
          for their children who were still quite young. If Mariano's properties
          were confiscated, we can only hope that perhaps she still had income
          from her casco cargo business.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life often presents us with heartbreaking events. When Mariano was a
          prisoner in Fort Santiago in 1896, surely he might have thought that
          if he and Jacinto ever got out of prison that they would be the last
          Limjaps imprisoned there. However, Mariano's youngest son, Pedro
          Arsenio Limjap, was taken there as a prisoner by the infamous Japanese
          secret police, the Kempeitei, just days before liberation, because of
          his guerilla activities. He was held in the equally infamous Fort
          Santiago dungeon and was never heard from again. A memorial marker is
          located on Fort Santiago's garden grounds in honor of Pedro and the
          other brave Filipinos who died there during that period of World War
          II.
        </p>

        <p>
          After centuries of putting down uprisings, the Spanish may have
          thought all would once again be forgiven. But this time they had gone
          too far. None of the non-Spanish in Manila could ever trust the
          Spanish authorities again. A special event took place during a brief,
          relatively peaceful interlude after the surrender of the Spanish and
          before the Philippine-American War began. That was the November 6,
          1898 founding of the Club Filipino Independiente, which bears special
          mention since its founding was more of a political statement than a
          social one. Although the matter of who was the country's ruling
          government was unsettled at the time, the founders were now at liberty
          to use the word "Filipino" in their club's name.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano was one of its founding fathers, along with Telesforo
          Chuidian. Other founders included some of those arrested with Mariano
          and Jacinto by the Spanish. These were Dr. Jose Albert, Bonifacio
          Arevalo, Antonio Luna, Jose Luna, Juan Luna, and Maximino Paterno.
        </p>

        <p>
          Club Filipino's inaugural ceremony and ball was the first major social
          event, unrelated directly to government, that the elite who supported
          the revolution held together. It was one of the grandest affairs in
          Philippine history. The club did not yet have a clubhouse, so the
          affair was held in the elegant residence of the Valentin Guidote
          family. Hundreds of people arrived from all over the Philippines. The
          Guidotes and Juan Luna decorated the house for the occasion. Telesforo
          Chuidian, the first Club President, gave his inaugural address. In
          honor of Dr. Jose Rizal, Rizal's "Ultimo Mi Dios" was recited that
          evening. The finest foods were served and orchestras played for an
          evening of ballroom dancing. It was a night like no other. Although
          Americans attended the festivities, when the Philippine-American War
          began in February 1899, Club Filipino members were among the first to
          rally around Emilio Aguinaldo.

          <span class="big-letter">T</span>he basic facts of the Philippine
          Revolution (August 1896-February 1899) and the Philippine-American War
          (February 4, 1899-September 8, 1902) are so well known that we haven't
          included them here. It was only after the Spanish-American War that
          America began to emerge as a world leader. Therefore, it should be
          noted that the Philippines was the first nation to fight this new
          super power.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of a review of the events of the revolution and war, we've
          focused on the various roles Mariano and Jacinto played during these
          turbulent periods. Highlights of General Arthur MacArthur's campaign
          of October-November 1899 are included because, as we will see in this
          chapter, this campaign affected Mariano, and it seems other members of
          the Limjap family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano wore many hats during these war-time years. He was named to a
          high-level, three-man finance committee, which also included Telesforo
          Chuidian and Pedro Paterno. They were authorized to sign paper
          currency in denominations of one, two, five, twenty, fifty, and one
          hundred pesos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano was also named Inspector General of the Railroad. The
          Manila-Dagupan Railway played an important part in transporting
          troops, supplies, and government officials to Malolos, then to Tarlac,
          and finally to Pangasinan. Thus, battles for control of the
          Manila-Dagupan Railroad were crucial. Copies of some letters from and
          to Mariano about his duties as the Railroad Inspector General are
          included in the photo section. One of these is from President Emilio
          Aguinaldo.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jacinto was named tax collector for Manila. Because the new government
          needed funds to operate, as they gained control of the countryside,
          the insurgent forces began immediately collecting the same taxes,
          including license fees that the Spanish had collected. There is every
          indication, that while the non-Spanish citizens had felt burdened by
          Spanish taxation, they freely and gladly gave to the rebel forces. An
          additional voluntary war tax was also collected. It was essential, of
          course, to have trustworthy individuals collecting the taxes and
          that's why often prominent persons were selected. For example, the
          Philippine patriot General Jose Ignacio Paua, the only Chinese (as
          opposed to Chinese-Mestizo) General in the war, also helped collect
          taxes in his area.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the seat of the revolutionary government was transferred to
          Tarlac on June 21, 1899, Mariano was one of the new members of
          Congress appointed to succeed those who were unable to reach Tarlac to
          attend the sessions, or those who had been captured, or who had
          already surrendered to the Americans. He was named the only
          representative of the Tarlac Congress from Manila where previously
          there had been four. The Tarlac Congress first met on July 14. Among
          other acts, this Congress passed laws reorganizing the country's
          finances. This was something to which Mariano could have contributed a
          great deal.
        </p>

        <p>
          When American forces advanced closer to Tarlac, the revolutionary
          government retreated aboard the Manila-Dagupan Railroad to Dagupan
          and, then, to Bayambang, Pangasinan.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the way, Mariano, as Inspector General of the Railroad, had the
          railroad behind them destroyed to delay American forces and provide
          more time for President Aguinaldo to escape once they reached
          Pangasinan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beginning in October 1899, the Americans launched a major offensive on
          Luzon, with the intention of capturing President Aguinaldo, and
          forcing the revolutionary government to surrender. It was a
          three-pronged attack plan to be conducted by American Army Generals
          Lawton, Wheaton, and MacArthur. General Lawton was to proceed
          northward up the Rio Grande River, then westward and head for Dagupan.
          General Wheaton was to sail from Manila to Lingayen Gulf and proceed
          with his column also to Dagupan, which was the end of the railroad
          line. General Arthur MacArthur was to proceed northward from Manila
          along the railroad line. Since most of Luzon's revolutionary forces
          were in central Luzon, the plan was to keep pushing them northward
          until all forces met in Pangasinan. It was a plan that worked only too
          well.
        </p>

        <p>
          As MacArthur's forces pushed northward, taking town after town, they
          forced President Aguinaldo, his military forces and officials to
          retreat northward on the railroad line, unaware at first that the
          other two generals were approaching from the other side.
        </p>

        <p>
          From Harper's History of the War, we have excerpts from some of the
          despatches sent by U.S. Commanding Philippine General Elwell S. Otis
          almost daily by wire to Washington. These provide us the status of the
          Luzon battles from an American perspective, and some information about
          Mariano's actions.

          destroy the railroad to Dagupan; also Captain Lawrence, Englishman,

          there were a few exceptions, these despatches usually did not provide
          the name of the person captured but rather that person's title or
          rank.)
        </p>

        <p>
          General Arthur MacArthur's forces had taken Bayambang, by then the
          seat of the Aguinaldo Government, on November 19, 1899. The
          despatches, although sent almost daily, were reporting events that
          sometimes had occurred a day or two before. Given that fact perhaps
          Mariano had managed to elude American forces for a day or two after
          they took Bayambang, but ultimately he was captured.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's clear Mariano stayed with the revolutionary government and at his
          post to the end, doing all he could to give more time to President
          Aguinaldo, the military forces, and other revolutionary government
          officials to escape.
        </p>

        <p>
          Surely, in 1899, General MacArthur could not have foreseen that his
          son, Douglas, would be the Supreme Allied Commanding General in the
          Allies' efforts to free Asia forty-five years later. Neither, in 1899,
          would Mariano have thought his daughter, Esperanza, would be First
          Lady of the Philippines forty-five years later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano's DPB bio states he was captured in Pangasinan with family
          members. Pangasinan is the correct place although a few written
          sources state he was captured in Tarlac. We don't know which family
          members were with him. These must have been trying times for the
          Limjaps. Their children were young, and Lola Angoy was expecting
          Felisa who would be born in January 1900 while, apparently, Mariano
          was in prison. Additionally, they were from Manila, which had long
          been under American control. In addition, many properties that were
          confiscated under the Spanish were not released until after the
          Americans took over the government. We don't know if Mariano's and
          Jacinto's properties were returned to them after their release by the
          Spanish or held until after the Philippine-American War. So, if his
          entire family was not with him, where were they? Written accounts
          report that President Aguinaldo's mother, sister, wife and children
          were with him, and that his mother and a child were captured in
          Pangasinan. Aguinaldo's youngest child, who had just been christened
          in Tarlac before the retreat, died and was buried in Bayambang,
          Pangasinan. President Aguinaldo's wife went with him to the mountains.
          Therefore, it's very possible the entire Limjap family was together as
          well. We assume that Mariano and any other Limjaps with him were
          brought back to Manila by steamer from Lingayen Gulf as were some
          other captured officials.
        </p>

        <p>
          The only good news that November was that the American's trap had not
          succeeded in capturing President Aguinaldo who had escaped to Palanan,
          lsabela. It, would take almost three more years before the Americans
          captured him and officially ended the war. Fighting, however,
          continued for years and the Philippine-American War now compared in
          many ways with America's involvement in Vietnam.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once in Manila, Mariano was imprisoned again. We believe that Jacinto
          was, too, but haven't yet found anything in writing on that. Telesforo
          Chuidian was put in prison at what sources state was Fort Bonifacio.
          But that must have been called Fort McKinley then. Most probably
          Mariano and Jacinto were imprisoned at Fort McKinley as well. We don't
          yet have the term of Mariano's imprisonment nor his release date from
          the Americans. We don't know the length of Telesforo Chuidian's prison
          term under the American, however, from his DPB biography, we know it
          was for less than the Spanish prison term. On December 6, 1900, Roman
          Ongpin was imprisoned by the Americans at Fort McKinley. Then, he was
          transferred to the Ermita American military headquarters, and finally
          released on March 23, 1901, or over three months later. Possibly,
          Jacinto's and Mariano's term was similar in length. Mr. Ongpin never
          forgave the Americans and refused to serve them in his store. Before
          being released prisoners had to sign an oath of allegiance to the
          United States Government.
        </p>

        <p>
          It seems in general the American imprisonments were not as harsh as
          those of the Spanish in 1896 and 1897. Still, any time in prison is
          intolerable. It could not have been easy for the prisoners or their
          families, especially when their only "crime" was patriotism.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the end of the war, a new era in Philippine history had begun.
          Some have criticized the mestizos, saying they did not fight the
          Americans after the war but, instead, became their friends and
          business associates. It's true that the early years of American
          occupation were years of strong economic growth. For the first time,
          there were opportunities for all that had not existed under the
          Spanish. And even though the Chinese mestizo had contributed heavily
          from their own funds to the revolution and the war, they were still in
          a better position to re-start their businesses and to take advantage
          of this new period of growth than many others were. Naturally, being
          among the national business leaders of the day, they were soon
          introduced to the American businessmen and government officials. Of
          course, the businesses the mestizos embarked upon after the war added
          employment for others, a fact seldom mentioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Bayambang, Pangasinan, General Aguinaldo had requested his soldiers
          and officials to switch from regular warfare to guerilla activities.
          The guerilla war continued for years because the people supported it.
          It's possible that, despite their oaths of allegiance, many of
          Aguinaldo's officials and military personnel also continued to help
          the guerillas in whatever way they could.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any case, at war's end, surely Mariano, Jacinto and the others had
          given their all. They had supported the move for reforms, had endured
          the Spanish arrests and the reign of terror. During the three years of
          war, they had devoted themselves, and their families, in every way
          they could in the struggle for Philippine independence. Their
          properties and assets had probably been confiscated. They had gladly
          given much of their fortunes, their brainpower, physical abilities and
          their time to the Philippines' struggle for independence. At the end
          of the war, they had again endured their arrests, this time by the
          Americans. Like all Filipinos of the time, their families had gone
          through tremendous upheaval and sacrifice. It's hard to see what else
          they could have given.
        </p>

        <p>
          After all, Mariano and Jacinto were not politicians but businessmen
          who tried to serve their country to the best of their abilities. If
          they were pragmatic, it was probably because they knew what America's
          financial and military might was, they knew the Americans had gained
          control of the Philippines. They knew they were defeated and they did
          not want to shed more Filipino blood needlessly. What else to do, for
          the sake of their families and fellow countrymen, but to seek peace?
        </p>

        <p>
          During the period from 1900 to 1920, Mariano again shifted gears,
          changed direction, and met the changing times head-on. He had not lost
          his business vision during the war years.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new Philippine Government had lost the war, but those involved in
          the struggle had hopes of eventually winning the peace, not just for
          themselves but for all Filipinos. What they had gained made up for the
          loss - for they had gained a new nationality, a right to call
          themselves - no longer indios or mestizos - but at last Filipinos.

        <h1>Chapter 10: Mariano's Last Decades</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">A</span>fter his release, Mariano
          accomplished a great deal as we have read in the section about his
          business career. But, perhaps his greatest pleasures came from his
          family, from seeing the Limjap children grow up and begin to spread
          their own wings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, his devotion to country, to community remained throughout his
          life. He also continued to assist needy students. It was during this
          time, he contributed toward putting up the Rizal National Monument in
          the Luneta.
        </p>

        <p>
          He especially enjoyed his friendships, one of which was with Architect
          Tomas Arguelles. They got together very often. Among his many other
          achievements, Tomas Arguelles later was President of Philippine
          Tannery, Inc., where Mariano had investments. Their families are still
          friends today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mariano also again enjoyed his social clubs, such as Club Filipino,
          which was then the "In" club, the Manila Jockey Club, another club
          with an elite membership, and a newer club, the Cosmos Club. In 1924,
          he was a Director of the Cosmos Club, which was located in the China
          Bank Building. During that year, Teodoro R. Yangco was its President,
          Gabriel Lao its Secretary, and Vicente Madrigal also a Director.
        </p>

          After the war, the Limjaps were again in Manila's social whirl. The
          following two accounts provide a glimpse into their position in the
          rarefied world of Manila high society during the early part of the
          20th century. These two receptions, described below, were held about
          one week apart and are just two among countless others they hosted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first was a reception which Mariano hosted in 1907 for U.S.
          Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Mrs. Taft, who were on a
          return visit to Manila for the opening of the First Philippine
          National Assembly. The Limjaps and the Tafts had known each other from
          the time Taft was Governor-General of the Philippines. Subsequently,
          Taft became U.S. President and then Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme
          Court.
        </p>

        <p>
          The November 6, 1907 edition of the
          <span class="em">Cablenews American</span>
          newspaper had the following account of it:
        </p>

        <p>
          Headlines: "Chinese Hosts" and "Splendid Reception at Mariano Limjap's
          to Secretary and Mrs. Taft" "Another of the long list of receptions in
          honor of the Secretary and Mrs. William H. Taft, has come and gone.
          Last evening at the palatial residence of Mariano Limjap, one of
          Manila's wealthiest native residents, a magnificent reception was
          given by the Chinese Consul General and the leading China-men [as
          written] in the city."
        </p>

        <p>
          "The wealth and beauty of Manila was in attendance. In the receiving
          line from Five O'Clock till Seven, stood the Secretary of War I
          William Howard Taft, the Chinese Consul General Su Yu Tsu, assisted by
          Benito Si Cobieng, the president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,
          and Tan Chu Tee, the instructor in English in the Chinese School."
        </p>

        <p>
          Edgar Wickberg noted the second one in his book (mentioned earlier).
          It concerns a Manchu emissary Yang Shih-chi, the Junior Vice President
          of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Trade, who also carried
          the title, Imperial Commissioner, who headed a delegation that paid an
          official visit to the Philippines. While there, he was entertained by
          the Limjaps, as well as by high government officials at other times
          during their visit. Twenty-one years earlier, Joaquin had assisted in
          making a request for a Chinese Consulate for Manila. Now his son
          Mariano gave one of the first groups of official Chinese visitors a
          royal welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wickberg wrote, "During its stay in Manila, the members of the mission
          were officially received by the Governor General of the Islands, were
          wined and dined by Chinese millionaire Mariano Limjap, in a mammoth
          reception that included the cosmopolitan crowd, and were entertained
          by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce."
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, it made news in the Cablenews American, this time from the
          November 14, 1907 edition:
        </p>

        <p>
          The Headline: "<span class="em"
            >Brilliant Reception Given at Handsome Residence of Mariano
            Limjap</span
          >"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Only a superabundance of superlatives could fittingly describe the
          oriental richness of the reception last night at the home of Mariano
          Limjap in honor of the Chinese dignitaries now in the city. A
          committee of local Chinese gentlemen met the visitors at the main
          entrance, and smilingly escorted them to the grand stairway. Major
          Robert H. Noble, Aide to the Governor-General, presented the visitors
          with his accustomed facility. In the receiving line were Consul
          General Su Yu Tchu [different spelling from previous excerpt]; Hon.
          H.E. Yang Shih Chi, the royal trade commissioner; Mrs. Lim Jap [as
          written]; Taotai Mue Yew Chung, former Consul General here and now
          deputy director-general of the Shanghai Nanking Railroad; Commodore
          Shen, commanding the Chinese cruiser
          <span class="em">Hai Chi</span>; and the president of the Chinese
          Chamber of Commerce of Manila."
        </p>

        <p>
          "The guests of whom hundreds crowded the beautiful mansion for three
          hours, included the Governor-General, members of the Commission,
          Assemblymen, Supreme Court Justices, the Consular Corps, all the
          prominent British, German, French, Swiss, Spanish, Filipino and
          American families, officers of the army and navy and many prominent
          civil officials. A score or more of the officers of the
          <span class="em">Hai Chi</span>
          were present in their dazzling white uniforms with gold epaulets."

          "A band of 20 pieces from the cruiser

          instruments were brasses and flutes. Under the direction of a leader
          of their own race [as written] the players sent forth sweet music

          court."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Mr. Limjap and his charming daughter [Note: Possibly, this was
          Leonarda, the eldest.] were busy all the evening looking after the
          comfort of their guests, and received countless felicitations because
          of the manifest success of the occasion. The illumination was
          beautiful. All four sides of the handsome residence in San Miguel were
          covered with white incandescents. Red and blue light circled one of
          the fountains in the main conservatory, strings of lights stretched
          from the rear balcony, and even in the trees in the yard shone myriads
          of red and blue lights. The other decorations consisted of immense
          silken banners of the Yellow Dragon of China, American flags and
          bunting, and ferns and potted plants."

              plata of Mariano Limjap and Maria Escolar. The photo was taken as
              dinner tables were setup but still without chairs before the party
              began.

        <p>
          In 1911, Mariano and Maria Escolar's 25th wedding anniversary was an
          elaborate celebration that began on the May 2nd anniversary date with
          additional celebrations held on May 3rd. The American Governor General
          W. Cameron Forbes was one of hundreds of guests.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early American era, the Limjaps continued to travel although we
          don't have records of all the trips. One was a steamer trip to Japan
          and China that Lola Angoy made in 1918, together with three of her
          daughters, Esperanza, Paciencia, and Felisa.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps during this time, Mariano's thoughts were beginning to turn to
          his own mortality for he bought the large Limjap land area in the
          North Cemetery, when that opened and, in 1913, constructed the Limjap
          Chapel, which still stands today. Adjacent to it is a large lot owned
          by the Ongpins. Each contains over 20 regular size lots. An
          interesting side note to that is that in 1997, when we made a search
          at the Manila City Hall Office of Cemeteries to verify the
          documentation of the Limjap plot, officials could not believe that two
          such large lots still belonged to only two families. On February 28,
          1922, Mariano signed his will, and on March 8, 1923, he attached a
          codicil.

          In 1923, his brother Jacinto died on December 7th at the San Juan de
          Dias Hospital. He was buried at the Limjap plot where a memorial
          tablet was placed for him in the Limjap Chapel. When Mariano died on
          March 4, 1926, his will became news and was printed in many
          newspapers. One headline in The Independent, dated March 20, 1926,
          read, "Testamento De Un Millonario" The full text of his will was
          printed.
        </p>

        <p>
          It appears he was in ill health and, at least for a while before his
          death, was confined to a wheelchair. Mariano Limjap y Nolasco - a
          business pioneer and a patriot - was buried on the left side of the
          Limjap Chapel.

          Lolo Mariano had adversities in life, particularly the deaths of
          family members and friends. Apparently, like others, he had financial
          losses during both the Spanish and American war years. But, all in
          all, it seems he led a very happy and very productive life. At the end
          of his life, he was surrounded by a large and loving family. He also
          had an extended family, for whom he cared and provided as if they were
          his own. He had friends with whom he enjoyed much fellowship. He had
          helped numerous people in less fortunate circumstances. He had
          achieved great success in business and his astute business acumen was
          well recognized. He had known a life of abundance and privilege and
          yet he was not a selfish or spoiled person. He was well respected by
          his peers and all who knew him. Before, during and after the
          Revolution and Philippine-American War, he committed himself and his
          resources with resolve and dedication to serving his country. He
          endured two imprisonments and emerged undaunted. He was truly a
          courageous man with the moral fiber required in such perilous times.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had been born in the Spanish society of mid-19th century
          Philippines and he had seen the beginnings of a modern
          American-influenced 20th century. When he died, it was truly the end
          of a very, very special era. But it was the beginning of an era he had
          fought so hard to bring about for Lolo Mariano had begun life as a
          Chinese mestizo but had died as a Filipino.

              Here, Lola Angoy, in the earliest photograph of her found so far,
              is the epitome of a fashionable young lady of the 19th century.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">P</span>erhaps Lola Angoy needed a respite
          from the hectic life she and Lolo Mariano had enjoyed. During the
          1930s, after Mariano's death, Lola Angoy built a house in Santa Mesa
          adjacent to the one Lolo Mariano had given the Osmenas. In addition,
          she built a house behind hers for her favorite nephew, Agapito Escolar
          and his family. Fewer family members remained at home and less space
          was required. Santa Mesa, although also a large, spacious house, was
          not as much of a palace as the San Miguel house. Neither did it
          require as much maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when some of her children - Francisco and his family and,
          subsequently, the widowed Paciencia and her family decided to move
          back in with her, she returned to San Miguel. In both homes, the
          family, particularly the grandchildren, had wonderful years of whole
          days spent at Lola Angoys on Thursdays (then a Catholic school
          holiday) and Sundays and of the memorable lunches they enjoyed
          together.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were also yearly vacations for the whole Limjap family,
          especially to Baguio where she had a huge house and to Antipolo where
          the Limjaps also had another summer house. Moving all the family
          members, their belongings and the helpers back and forth for these
          vacations was something like transporting a small army with Ate Monang
          as the very able supervising general.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lola Angoy had frequent visits from her cousins, Lola Marcelina
          "Ninay" Que Viuda de Rodriguez, Lola Isabel Carreon and Lola Julia
          Catot. It is reported by Marita Escolar Alfonso that Lola Angoy is
          also related to Dominga Escolar Co Gue Fue who is the paternal
          grandmother of Ambassador Manuel Yan. From Floring Azarraga and Johnny
          Rodriguez, we learned more about the cousins. Lola Ninay was a
          Spanish-Chinese mestiza, and Lola Angoy's first cousin on the Carreon
          side. Their mothers were sisters. She was the grandmother of Floring
          Azarraga and Johnny Rodriguez. Lola Ninay was Lola Angoy's Ate and, as
          such, received deferential treatment by our Lola Angoy. When Lola
          Ninay came to visit at San Miguel, Lola Angoy was waiting up by the
          stairs with the other members of the family and with the servants.
          Lola Ninay died in 1944, at age 82, and a memorial tablet for her is
          in the Limjap Chapel. Lola Isabel was a piano teacher and never
          married.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, she stayed with the Ubaldos until she died. Perhaps Maria
          Isabel, the Limjaps fourth child who died at aged two, was named for
          her. Lola Julia Catot was a cousin, and probably also on the Carreon
          side although no one can say for sure. Both Lola Isabel and Lola Julia
          were very Spanish looking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lola Angoy continued to provide college educations for a number of
          people, including Dr. Rosalino Reyes, Amado Javier, Pacifico Javier,
          and two priests, Father Rufino and Father Felipe.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sculptor Guillermo Tolentino recommended Dr. Reyes to Lolo
          Mariano, who spoke briefly with the young man to tell him that he
          would be a Limjap scholar in Medicine at UP. However, a few days
          later, Lolo Mariano died and with him the dreams of the student. At
          the wake, he assisted the family by listing all the flowers that had
          been sent. After the period of mourning, Lola Angoy told him that
          whatever Lolo Mariano had promised him was still a good promise. He
          said his spirits then soared to new heights. He lived with the Limjaps
          in San Miguel, where his daily chores were to give Lola Angoy her
          insulin shots and to accompany her in the early morning hours when she
          enjoyed tending her garden. Subsequently, after finishing Medicine,
          Dr. Reyes took up law and became the Medico Legal Officer of the old
          National Bureau of Investigation. He is now 94 years old, and the only
          surviving Limjap scholar.

        </figure>
        <p>
          During this period, Lola Angoy suffered from increasing ill health.
          She had severe diabetes and needed daily insulin shots, which were
          given to her at home by Dr. Reyes and later by Amado Javier. We are
          indebted to Ben Javier, with whom the Limjaps are very close, for
          providing more details of the earlier relationships between the two
          families. Amado and his brother Pacifico were scholars of Lola Angoy.
          After high school, both stayed with the Limjaps and after their
          college graduation, Amado and Pacifico both worked for PLDT. Their
          father managed a motor boat owned by Don Mariano named the Dona Angoy,
          which towed fishing vessels. Their other brother, Alfredo, was the
          Dona Angoy's Engineer and the Javier's employee Pascual Roque was the
          captain. Their mother Antonia would collect the earnings, which she
          would turn over to Lola Angoy. Ben remembers going with his mother to
          visit Lola Angoy at the San Miguel house. At his mother's request, Ben
          stayed with Jose Limjap's family from December 1941 to January 1942,
          but because World War II had broken out, Ben returned to their house
          to be with his mother. Ben now has a very successful commercial
          fishing venture and exports tuna fish to Japan.

          On April 7, 1941, Lola Angoy died while at her Baguio summer home just
          before the annual trek to Antipolo. Shortly before she went up to
          Baguio, a picture was taken which shows her relaxing at Tagaytay with
          her daughter-in-law Simona Ablaza Limjap, who was pregnant at the time
          with Monina Limjap Alvarez. Little did anyone suspect then that Simona
          would die on March 25, 1941, after giving birth to Monina, and that
          Lola Angoy would die less than a month later. Lola Angoy was a
          disciplinarian, but she had a caring, loving heart for those she loved
          and also for the less fortunate. This is part of her legacy to us.
          During the Revolution and the Philippine-American War, Lola had also
          lived through times that were harrowing, particularly when her husband
          was in prison and she had small children who needed her care. These
          were times which would have devastated a weaker person. And she had
          suffered from her diabetic condition. Lola Angoy is the matriarch we
          remember, the one who set the standards for our behavior, the one who
          cared enough to be the disciplinarian and set an example we could
          follow all our lives.

        <p>
          <span class="big-letter">I</span> recall that I was about two years of
          age when I rode on a wheelchair with my grandfather, Mariano Limjap.
          Later in life, I asked my mother how come I grew up with my
          grandmother (whom l called Lola Angoy). She told me that at the time
          of my grandfather's death, she and father were abroad and when they
          returned to Manila, they noticed that my Lola became very attached to
          me so that they did not have the heart to take me back. My Lola took
          me with her wherever she went - to church (Santo Domingo, in
          Intramuros) every Tuesday and Sunday, which I did not relish because
          she woke me up at four in the morning, to religious processions, to
          afternoon spins in the car and to visit her friends, especially Dona
          Chayong Imperial. She would make me show tricks like moving my ears
          and making my ears stick to the side of my head.
        </p>

        <p>
          My grandmother was a disciplinarian. She was very strict especially at
          the dining table and was very observant about the way are ate and the
          manner in which we handled the silverware. She would continually
          repeat that we should know how to eat properly so that we would not be
          embarrassed when eating in a banquet when we grew up. Dinner time to
          her was very important. She would have a gong sounded and everyone had
          to come immediately. Everyone had to sit and eat at the same time and
          also leave the dining table at the same time. Every night, before
          retiring, we prayed the Rosary in Spanish.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although my relatives believed that I was a favorite grandchild, I did
          not think so at the time because I got punished very often. Punishment
          meant the "plumero" on the buttock which hurt a lot. Afterwards, my
          Ate Monang would apply a "contusion" solution on the affected area.
          While spanking me, my Iola would cry and would keep repeating that it
          was hurting her more than it did me. Of course, I did not think so,
          but could not say so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lola did not believe in pocket money as "baon" so I had to bring a
          sandwich to school. And, at lunch lime, our driver had to bring my
          lunch all the way from Santa Mesa, pick me up at De La Salle College
          in Taft Avenue, and drive to Fort Abad at the end of Dewey Boulevard
          to eat my lunch. In the afternoons, Lola would pick me up in school,
          ask the driver to make a spin at the Luneta and then drive home. One
          thing my Lola did not believe in was the "barkada," so I had none. She
          was so strict with me and watched all my movements that some of my
          relatives called me "ang dalaga nang Lola." Lola also did not believe
          in the movies, but my mother would have me picked up every Thursday
          (we had no classes) to go to the dentist, but actually took me to the
          movies. I had a feeling that Lola knew all along and referred to my
          mother as a "consentidora." As a young boy I resented the strict
          treatment I got, but later on in life, I realized that my grandmother
          was right. Considering the number of times I was punished, I probably
          would have been a problem later on in life if my Lola was not as
          strict as she was. Just imagine - when I was in the second grade, my
          grades in one particular month were so bad that I falsified my lola's
          signature in the monthly report card. Of course, I got caught and the
          succeeding punishment followed.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was eighteen years of age, Lola decided to return me to my
          mother. She told me that my sister, Rosie, who was starting to go on
          dates would be needing a chaperon. I was jumping for joy when I got to
          my mother's house in the afternoon from school before I realized that
          my Lola was there crying and took me back with her. The next day,
          however, she took me back to my mother's house and said that what she
          did the previous day was wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          My Lola Angoy died that summer in her summer house in Baguio, where
          she was spending the summer in her eight bedroom summer house with her
          seven children and their families as she did every year.
          Unfortunately, I was not there since I was at Camp Murphy (now Camp
          Aguinaldo) as a member of the first batch of High School Graduate
          trainees.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back, I am all praise for what my Lola Angoy has done for me.
          She would tell me, time and again of an old saying in Tagalog and I
          quote - "Ang alaga nang lola ay alaga ng demonio."

      <article class="content">
        <h1>Limjap Family Residences</h1>
        <p><span class="em">by Pacita Ubaldo Filart</span></p>

        <hr />

        <h4>The San Miguel House</h4>
        <p>
          The Limjap residence in San Miguel was at the foot of Ayala bridge on
          the corner of Echague Street The entrance of the mansion had a big
          gate, on the left side of the gate was a circular fountain, and around
          the fountain was a pathway to the main entrance of the house.
        </p>

        <p>
          On both sides of the first floor there was a line of bedrooms for the
          boys, Lolo Mariano's office and other facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon entering the door of the house, there was a big entresuelo
          leading to two marble stairways with huge wooden balustrades, one on
          the left and another on the right. At the landing, these two stairways
          met each other in the center and became one very wide stairway going
          to the second floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The very spacious and long second floor anteroom led to a very large
          living room that consisted of the whole width of the house fronting
          Calle Echague. The wood used for floors was perhaps a meter wide for
          each piece. The furniture and statues were from Europe, and large
          porcelain vases were from China. On the walls were tapestries also
          from Europe and paintings by noted painters. One of these was
          Amorsolo's "Harvest Time." The curtains were of velvet.
        </p>

        <p>
          The house had two dining rooms, also on the second floor. The largest
          dining room was vast and had a long, long table, with elaborate
          carvings, which could seat at least 50 people, and was made of one
          piece of prize mahogany. Around the dining room walls were tall,
          freestanding china cabinets, which held European porcelain plate sets
          decorated with flowers, and with Lolo Mariano's initials, M.L. in
          gold. These plates were only used on very special occasions or for
          fiestas. The everyday dining room used by adults was also very large
          and there was a smaller, separate dining room just for the use of the
          grandchildren.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second floor had two large bedrooms, one was the master's bedroom
          and the other was for the girls. In that era, bedrooms were only for
          sleeping and so there were also spacious dressing rooms for them. The
          kitchen was huge and as located near the dining rooms and had a
          separate stairway leading down to the servants' quarters and the
          garage.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were many people employed in the household staff. For the upkeep
          of the house, there were houseboys and housemaids. There was also a
          Master Chef with other helper assigned just to help the cook. On the
          third floor, accessed through a spiral cast iron staircase, imported
          from Europe, which had many detailed designs, was a gallery, called
          the mirador. This was, in fact, a roof garden and a large room where
          the grandchildren stayed when they visited. It was also used as a
          cardroom for social gatherings during Mariano's lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the numerous parties, children were not to be seen or heard.
          So, we would watch the parties below from the third-floor mirador
          where we could also see what was happening in the garden.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the garden, we had our own big playhouse where we played
          bahay-bahayan. Here, there was also a big space that was paved which
          was used for parties and, later, was used as a basketball court or a
          tennis court. The garage held one of the first cars in the
          Philippines. Over the years, the cars included a Metallurgic car, the
          latest Hudsons, seven-seater Dodges, a small Austin, and some vintage
          touring cars as well.
        </p>

        <h4>The Baguio Vacation House</h4>

        <p>
          Our grandparents' home in Baguio had eight bedrooms, a master's bed
          room and one for each son and daughter. This house also had two dining
          rooms, one for the adults and the other for the grandchildren. The
          grandchildren were always fed first by their parents and, when they
          were finished, the adults would eat. The grandchildren would go up to
          Baguio with their grandparents, ahead of their parents. Every Holy
          Week the house was filled with family and friends. In those days, it
          started to rain in Baguio in the month of April. When the rains came,
          the whole family would go down to another summer house in Antipolo for
          the May festivities.
        </p>

        <h4>The Antipolo Summer House</h4>

        <p>
          Antipolo was noted then as now for the Miraculous Lady of Peace and
          Good Voyage which is enshrined in the Church of Antipolo. Tourists and
          devotees would fill the church during these times. Every year, we
          would stay in Antipolo for two novenas (18 days) during the month of
          May.
        </p>

        <figure class="sm-img-figure left">
          <img
            class="img-select"
            src="./i/ch-11-05.jpg"
            alt="House in Antipolo."
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          The house had rooms large enough to accommodate family and friends
          from Manila who would come to visit during that time. There was also a
          nearby family ranch, called "Langhaya", located outside Antipolo.
          Every year we would go there for picnics. To get there, some would
          ride on paragos, a wheel-less cart pulled by a carabao, and others
          would ride horses. From the ranch, a calf would be selected for the
          barbecue held for family and friends back in town.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the town's procession, the young people would dress up. The girls
          would wear a Balintawak and the boys camisa de chino, which is printed
          and very colorful. In the evening after the procession, everyone went
          to "May Time", a place for socializing, dancing and eating.
        </p>

        <p>
          After these events every year, the family would go down to Manila to
          get ready for the school year that began in June.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I remember about these houses is that the mansion in San Miguel,
          which was turned into a headquarters and a shipyard by the Japanese,
          was burned and dynamited by the Japanese before they left. The
          residence in Baguio was burned during liberation. Meanwhile, the
          Antipolo summer house was not bombed nor burned but was subsequently
          looted up to the last post as it was abandoned during the war years.

        <h1>My Recollections Of Lola Angoy</h1>
        <p><span class="em">By Raul A. Boncan</span></p>
        <hr />

        <figure class="sm-img-figure right">
          <img src="./i/ch-11-07.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          My first recollection of Lola Angoy is in the house in Santa Mesa.
          That must have been when I was about five years old, or about 1933.
          She was then to me a very imposing woman who we respected with awe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember her dog Soda, a fox terrier, who liked to chase the
          grandchildren. Soda scratched my nose with his teeth once when I
          pulled his tail while he was eating. Lola Angoy, however, did not get
          angry at Soda. Instead, she gave me the feeling that it was my fault!
          The rule of the house and I think this carried over to all the Limjap
          households was that, if you hurt yourself through your own fault,
          you'd get spanked only if you cried. So, there was very little crying
          that you would hear in the Limjap households.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember that every Thursday there would be a long line (about 30 or
          4O) of mendicants who would sit down on both sides of the driveway
          from Santa Mesa Street to the house, and my Lola would come out and
          give each person one or two centavos. She also had a pet monkey at the
          back of the house. The yard and garden were very big and at night when
          we played "kick the can", if you were the first "It", most likely, you
          would be "It" for the whole night.
        </p>

        <p>
          My cousin Monching lived with Lola Angoy even if their own house was
          right beside hers in Santa Mesa. The Escolars' house was right behind
          the Osmena's and contiguous to Lola Angoy's without any fence.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember lauriat parties in Santa Mesa. We, the grandchildren, were
          allowed to join at a separate table in the corner. I, for one, did not
          know how to partake of a lauriat feast where there would be about ten
          or twelve different courses. I would gobble up the first two or three
          dishes and could not eat anymore for the next eight to ten dishes. The
          caterer would always be Chua, and he would be working together with
          all his cooks and waiters right in the back yard where all their
          kitchen paraphernalia to cook for about 100 people were located.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lola Angoy was very well loved and respected by our parents. We, the
          grandchildren, would only talk to her when we were spoken to. I do not
          remember exactly the transfer back to San Miguel. All I can remember
          is that we would be going to San Miguel instead of to Santa Mesa on
          Thursdays and Sundays. In fact, for a while, I lived with my Lola
          Angoy in San Miguel when my parents went to Europe or the United
          States for about two months.
        </p>

        <p>
          I later found out from my mother that she left some money with Ate
          Monang, who it seems hated to spend money, for my gustillos - like
          mongo con hielo or sarsaparilla. However, when they returned, the
          whole amount was given back to her, which means I did not get all the
          mongo con hielo or sarsaparilla that I could have had since I was not
          given the money for them. By that time, Monching Osmena, and Naning
          and Mon Santos were also staying there, and so were Amado and Pequing
          Javier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember that Lola Angoy had a black 7-seater Dodge, a Ford station
          wagon, and a small Austin. We almost always used the Ford or the
          Austin. It was very seldom that we used the Dodge. While Lola Angoy
          reigned in both houses, it was Ate Monang who ruled the households
          insofar as the grandchildren were concerned.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ate Monang was very strict with the grandchildren, particularly the
          boys. She dominated our lives with regards to the goodies. She would
          allow us each one face of the mango or two "buto". She would ration us
          about five lanzones each. So, to make it worthwhile eating them, we
          boys would pool the lanzones and bet it all on a basketball game -
          winner take all! After Lola Angoy died, Ate Monang lived ultimately
          with Lonnie Ubaldo Tirona.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once when Lola Angoy went to Hong Kong for a long vacation, I remember
          that a number of older grandchildren and some parents went too, but
          Monching and I stayed behind in Hong Kong with her and we went to
          school there. I was in kindergarten at Maryknoll's and Monching went
          to St. Joseph's (LaSalle) across the street. We brought the Ford
          station wagon, which we rode to school, as there were hardly any cars
          in Hong Kong then as the mode of transportation was the rickshaw. We
          stayed at the Kowloon Hotel, behind the Peninsula.
        </p>

        <p>
          We were occupying almost the entire floor. The driver, whose name, if
          I remember correctly, was Bonifacio was also a good cook of Filipino
          food. Ate Monang was, of course, also with us and always took care of
          all our needs. We must have stayed there for at least six months.
          Could this perhaps have been when she was in the process of
          transferring back to San Miguel? During that time, my parents would
          just visit us from Manila.
        </p>

        <p>
          Towards the late 1930s and early 1940s, Lola Angoy was not as active
          anymore. I do not remember any lauriats in San Miguel. She would sit
          on a deck chair with canvass in the smaller dining room in San Miguel
          or inside her big bedroom in Baguio during summer vacations. She
          smoked the long black, cigarettes and would always have pate de foie
          gras, which she liked very much, in the fridge, available when she
          decided to have some.
        </p>

        <p>
          She ate the crust but did not eat the "masa" of the bread and would
          fashion them into small animals, like ducks or dogs. I also got into
          the same habit as I do not also eat the masa of the bread and I still
          do fashion the masa into all sorts of shapes. She had an elevator
          installed so she did not have to climb the long high stairs in San
          Miguel. I always tried to ride with her on the elevator for 5:00 A.M.
          Sunday mass at the Santo Domingo Church. Otherwise, I had to run,
          after making the sign of the cross, all the way down in the
          frightening darkness, and had to open the very heavy, gigantic
          church-like doors to get to where the car was waiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          We, the grandchildren, did not dare come up to Lola Angoy and outright
          ask her for anything that we wanted unlike the grandchildren of today.
          We feared that we might offend her as she was a disciplinarian. I
          could not understand then why my cousins would always ask me to ask
          Lola Angoy for something that we would all like. Perhaps I was more
          daring or just plain naive.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked by them, I would approach Lola Angoy hesitatingly, and ask
          her in a roundabout way. I would start by saying, "Lola, kung gusto po
          ninyo, palagyan po natin nang tubig ang swimming pool" ("Lola, if you
          would want to, let us put some water in the swimming pool") And,
          almost always, she would say yes and that would make all of us very
          happy except Ate Monang. This would entail a lot of water since there
          was no filtering system available then and the water would have to be
          thrown away after a week when algae started to turn the water green.
        </p>

        <p>
          This would cost a lot of money. Ate Monang would ask us not to open
          the outlet valve too strong as she thought this would mean more water
          consumed. She would be watching from the second floor window. We would
          instead put two or three garden hoses full blast from an angle that
          she could not see in order to get the pool filled quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Christmas gifts to her grandchildren, Lola Angoy would, through
          one of my uncles, order them from a mail-order catalog in the U.S.
          There were over thirty grandchildren. All the boys of the same age
          would get the same thing and all of the girls, by age group also,
          would get the same thing, too. Our presents were always the latest
          designs from the States. Once we got skatings that looked very
          futuristic unlike the ordinary ones that were being sold in the
          Philippines at that time. After doing all the skating we wanted to at
          Burnham Skating Rink in Baguio, we would rent out our much in demand
          skates to others for pocket money.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another time, Lola Angoy gave each of her children's family a horse. I
          was still too small to ride by myself. A servant would hold me on top
          of the horse while he walked and ran the horse around. My parents did
          not know how to care for a horse. We did not even have a stable.
          Unfortunately, I think the horse died of pneumonia.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of Lola Angoy's favorite spots when we would take a spin in the
          Ford was at the big open ground of Fort San Antonio Abad, which then
          encompassed the space now filled by Ospital ng Manila, Harrison Plaza
          all the way to Vito Cruz. The sea was where Roxas Boulevard is now in
          front of the Central Bank Complex. The fort is still there behind the
          Central Bank building. It was a wide open, breezy place where we loved
          to fly our gurion fighting kites. At San Miguel, we also flew our
          kites on the third floor roof deck since the wind was always strong at
          that height.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember that Lola Angoy loved to look at her collection of loose
          diamonds which were kept in boxes with felt trays. She would move one
          diamond from left to the middle and look at it from different angles
          and then move it to the right. After she has finished one tray, she
          would start with another. Her "alajera" - Aling Charing - visited Lola
          Angoy regularly. Aling Charing's husband did the actual fashioning of
          the different kinds of jewelry. She continued to be the alajera of our
          parents. After the war, she lived in Pasay and I often accompanied my
          mother there.
        </p>

        <p>
          All laundry was done by outside contractors, who washed the laundry on
          the river banks of the San Juan or Marikina Rivers. This was quite a
          detailed procedure. The laundry was taken out of a big "hamper" where
          sometimes we would hide when playing hide and seek. The laundry would
          be sorted and every piece counted and recorded with Ate Monang
          supervising. The dirty laundry would then be put together on bedsheets
          and the ends tied together and mounted on a karetella. When the
          laundry was returned, every single item was counted again to ensure it
          conformed to the last list of outgoing laundry.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this was only one area of housekeeping. Now, I appreciate the
          tasks and responsibilities that Ate Monang had. However, then the
          cousins enjoyed trying to outwit Ate Monang. She had to keep track of
          all the household inventory bought in bulk, such as the chichariyas,
          groceries and fruits in the huge household bodega, and she closely
          guarded the keys to it. So we, the cousins, would go into the bodega
          with Ate Monang when she would go in to retrieve some things. We would
          then try to confuse her and one of us would hide behind the boxes and
          when she left with the others and locked the door, the one inside
          would later open the door from the inside and we would raid the
          bodega.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Ate Monang was very stingy with us, we now appreciate that we
          had to be handled the way we were handled. It has instilled in me the
          habit of not being wasteful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lola Angoy died suddenly in Baguio while we were on vacation. They had
          to round up all the grandchildren all over town since all of us had to
          go down to Manila the very same day. It was a sad day for all of us.
          Our lives were never the same.

          The Chinese saying,
          <br />
          <em class="bold">"May you live in interesting times!"</em>
          <br />
          has certainly more than applied to the lives of the Limjaps <br />
          and to the House of Limjap.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a final tribute to our Limjap ancestors
          <br />
          and particularly to <br />
          Lim Cong Jap (Joaquin Barera Limjap) and Policarpia Nolasco, <br />
          and to their children, <br />
          Mariano and Maria Escolar and Jacinto and Clotilde Alonzo, <br />
          we applaud their exemplary lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          When called upon,
          <br />
          they gladly sacrificed for their nation. <br />
          In peacetime, they set examples for us <br />
          by their religious beliefs, their love of family, <br />
          their industriousness, and their service to their communities. <br />
          And, they also taughtus to laugh, to enjoy life, <br />
          to appreciate the goodness that life has to offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          When World War II came,
          <br />
          we could bear it all <br />
          because they had shown us how. <br />
          After the war, just as they had, <br />
          we could also forgive <br />
          and go on with our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chinese mestizo family that
          <br />
          Lim Cong Jap and Policarpia Nolasco <br />
          Started is now a clan of <br />
          about 500 members.

        <h1>Salamat Po</h1>
        <p>
          This is a story of an immigrant who became a successful businessman;
          his children who risked the fruits of their family's labor as well as
          their entire family's safety and well being to contribute to the
          Philippine Revolution for a country they called their home.
        </p>
        <p>
          During these tumultuous times, it is ok to step out of your comfort
          zone and contribute to society in ways you normally would never dream
          of doing. To pass on your hopes and dreams of what you would like your
          country to be like for your children as well as your children's
          children is a courageous and selfless act. To risk tremendously for
          the sake of love of humanity is the greatest legacy our future can
          inherit.
        </p>

        <p>
          To Raul A Boncan y Limjap. Thank you for granting me the permission to
          share our family history to the world. Thank you to your family for
          dedicating the time, resources and energy to share this important
          piece of Filipino history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maraming Salamat Po! <br />-
